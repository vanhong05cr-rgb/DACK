            "⚠ Translation error: 'Dreams of Winter' is the first installment in the sci-fi series, 'A Forgotten God's Tale.' It is written by Freed, a US Army veteran, who has plenty of experience writing military fantasy novels, with over 20 books under his belt to date. Freed has a talent for immersing the reader into his fantasy worlds, and this story is no exception. Many pages are devoted to building the society in which his scenes take place, with rich and detailed descriptions. The story does tend to take a slower pace, as a result of the elaborate world-building and character backstories, so it will be popular among those who enjoy a more measured speed with comprehensive scene and character development. The result of Freed's well-crafted descriptive narration is a believable set of characters with consistent personalities and actions. This story will be a joy to read for fantasy and sci-fi fans and will leave them hungry for the next volume. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: An incredibly thorough survey of the Jesus' life through many lenses, overlaid with deep historical context about Israel in the first century. Jesus and the Victory of God continues from the extensive ground-laying done in the first book in the series: The New Testament and the People of God . As with that book, JVG is, unfortunately, significantly longer than it needed to be (it took me a year to chew through it!), quite repetitive at times, and engages a lot with a wide range of scholars that I, as a lay reader, will probably never hear from again. That said, this was well worth reading. I had some real \"aha\" moments where I got a clearer picture of how the synoptic Gospel accounts bridge to the seeming theological leaps that marked off the Way from the rest of Judaism. At other times, the dazzling radiance of Jesus simply jumped off the page. The best compliment I can think of is that after 800+ pages of scholarly synthesis of the life of Jesus in its full historical context, the picture that emerges from this book is clear and lucid, even to the point of seeming obvious in retrospect. Jesus took the rich tapestry of ideas, symbols, and promises of first-century Judaism and wrapped them entirely around himself in a way that was both cryptic and obvious: whoever this is, he is no mere teacher. What, in the end, made Jesus operate in this way, what energized his incorporating death into his mission, his facing it and going to meet it? The range of abstractly possible answers is enormous. But it is above all in the tradition generated by Jesus that we discover what made him operate in the way he did, what made him epitomize his life in the single act of going to his death: He ‘loved me and handed himself over for me’; ‘having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end’...If authenticity lies in the coherence between word and deed, our question has found an answer. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: You know, some books take a while to percolate down to your subconscious. This delightfully unassuming book - in itself a literary sleeper, a supernatural depth charge - has, over time, changed my LIFE. This is my personal nomination for My Favourite Non-Fiction Book of 2022. *** Christian Wiman was at first at loggerheads with my deepest intuitions. And I have let intuition guide my life, whereas Wiman relies on discursive thought and meditation to produce his sensitively intelligent life and poetry. His life has at its centre a sensitive, mystical void. In my life I possess in all its fullness the mystic banal. For me that's enough. *** My plenitude is dull; his abyss is bright. I'm afraid to change places with him. For if he's right, the Truth is Terror. And it's funny - I started reading this one in the days before the full horror of COVID was even anticipated. Well, COVID then forced me into a further retreat from the intricate head games of the world, thankfully, into the dull plenitude of a dutiful househusband's daily routine. That for me was always enough. Alone with my whittled integrity, the presence of God was within. He certainly can't be in the nebulous nothingness Wiman discerns in his tentative forays through time and space! Those bear a remarkable resemblance to the strange bursts of opaque white light that dominate the late canvasses of the abstract expressionist painter Jean-Paul Riopelle - as if they had appeared to him in a vision. They almost scare me. And as I - along with the world - have perforce spent long periods of time with myself, my wife, and our pet in isolation, with the virus I initially felt the chill fingers of dread crawling into my heart, as Wiman did when suddenly sidelined, disabled by a serious illness. *** My heart responded to the challenge with love. Wiman sought clarity while I cannot help but dwell on in aporetic endurance. You know, your heart is either alive or seriously muted. Perhaps mine was dead. Wiman's is always muted by intellectual poetic objectivity. Is that emptiness? Mine underwent a radical reboot in the aloneness of social distancing, but then sputtered. When, after suffering from a broken psyche 52 years ago I recovered and started to emotionally flourish, I just left it at that, and tried to think without thinking. I threw objectivity out the window. That was the start. The Absurd then cut clean through all my discursive red tape. And started to cut to the core of my heart. But is Wiman perhaps further along the right track? Perhaps the Bright Abyss is that absurdity - resolved and dissipated into emptiness. Maybe Wiman is right. Maybe I should get off the sidelines! Thus I mused. So I applied his thoughts to my life. And guess what? I can now say am finally able to let go of a LOT of my awful past. So maybe it's time to throw away ALL my diffidence, my ego - ALL My doubts, all my words, and everything about my plain discursive thought - Into My Bright Abyss... And into the Sunlight of Being! --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: This book is a gorgeous meditation on poetry, faith, and suffering. Written by Christian Wiman, a man who grew up Christian, drifted away from faith, and then came back, it is a gorgeous look at all the way complex ways we interact with our faith. This is not grade school Christianity. The book is also driven by the urgency of Wiman's diagnosis with a rare cancer that is unpredictable, that could kill him in a few months, or that he could fight off for years. I underlined lines on nearly every page as he articulated ideas about poetry or God in ways that I either hadn't thought of, or that I hadn't figured out how to express. Like: \"Our minds are constantly trying to bring God down to our level rather than letting him lift us into levels of which we were not previously capable.\" (49) \"Human imagination is not simply our means of reaching out to God but God's means of manifesting himself to us.\" (61) \"Sometimes God calls a person to unbelief in order that faith may take new forms.\" (61) \"Innocence, for the believer, remains the only condition in which intellectual truths can occur, and wonder is the precondition for all wisdom. . . . To be innocent is to retain that space in your heart that once heard a still, small voice saying not your name so much as your nature, and the wherewithal to say again and forever your worldless but lucid, your triumphant but absolute, yes.\" ----- This one really resonated with me, as for years, I tried to will myself into belief, or faith, forgetting all about the need for wonder, the need for love. \"the very practical effects of music, myth, and image, which tease us not out of reality, but deeper and more completely into it.\" (90) \"We live in and by our senses, which are conditioned in and by our deaths . . . . And this is why poetry is so powerful, and so integral to any unified spiritual life: it preserves both aspects of spiritual experience, because to name is to praise and lose in one instant. So many ways of saying God.\" (119) \"We do not need definite beliefs (i.e. details of specific religions) because their objects are necessarily true. We need them because they enable us steady spots from which the truth may be glimpsed. . . . Definite beliefs are what make the radical mystery - those moments when we suddenly know there is a God, about whom we \"know\" absolutely nothging - accessible to us and our ordinary, unmysterious lives. And more crucially: definite beliefs enable us to withstand the storms of suffering that come into every life, and that tend to destroy any spiritual disposition that does not have deep roots.\" (113) As such: \"To have faith in a religion, any religion, is to accept at some primary level that its particular language of words and symbols says something true about reality.\" (141) And then here I'm going to quote an entire page, because he articulates exactly how and why I am a Christian: \"I'm a Christian not because of the resurrection (I wrestle with this), and not because I think Christianity contains more truth than other religions (I think God reveals himself, or herself, in many forms, some not religious) . . . I am Christian because of that moment on the cross when Jesus, drinking the very dregs of human bitterness, cries out, 'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' (I know, I know: he was quoting the Psalms, and who quotes a poem when being tortured? The words aren't the point. The point is he felt human destitution to its absolute degree: the point is that God is WITH US, not beyond us, in suffering). I am a Christian because I understand that moment of Christ's passion to have meaning in my own life, and what it means is that the absolute solitary and singular nature of extreme human pain is an illusion . . . Christ's suffering shatters the iron walls around individual human suffering, that Christ's compassion - to the point of death, even - possible. Human love CAN reach right into death, then, but not if it is MERELY human love.\" (155). I could go on quoting, because the book keeps on growing from here, but this gives a pretty good taste of the book, I think, and these are the quotes to which I want to make sure I have the quickest access. I recommend this book to any Christian, or anyone interested in religion, or in the transcendent power of poetry, or in how someone copes with the suffering of terminal cancer. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: Christian Wiman is an exquisite wordsmith and his beautiful prose is on full display in his memoir \"My Bright Abyss: Meditation of a Modern Believer.\" Wiman, who was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, offers his reflections on God, life, death, doubt, belief, art, and his own return to faith. Wiman spends a lot of time analysing poetry and drawing out its meaning and truth. Along with poets like George Herbert, Richard Wilbur and Seamus Heaney, Wiman also engages with the pantheon of luminaries admired by liberal Christians, such as Paul Tillich, Simone Weil, Thomas Merton and Jürgen Moltmann. As another reviewer has remarked, Wiman tends to indulge in apophatic aphorisms about God (\"God comes as an annihilating silence, a silence we must ENDURE as well as enjoy,\" pg 108). As I worked through the book I found myself becoming increasingly vexed. Part of that is the form - the book is a collection of short fragments, more often than not less than a full page and not in a linear fashion. Perhaps it's just that in the Internet age EVERYONE feels they need to express their opinions in a blog post (I am pro-priesthood of all believers but not blogosphere of all believers) and Wiman, as he has confronted the strenuous experience and torment of cancer treatment, is certainly a great deal more eloquent and thoughtful than most bloggers, but the form of the book almost makes it seem like just a collection of blog posts strung haphazardly together with no overarching structure. But I also read \"My Bright Abyss\" quickly, taking time to pause, but perhaps it will resonate more with me in a few years at a slower pace. But I felt far more exasperated by how Wiman spends so much time insisting on how we cannot fully comprehend God while at the same time suffusing every page with his own metaphysical speculations. I find this rather tedious because he so seldom interacts with Scripture - with what we HAVE been given that discloses our knowledge of God. It's ironic to me that a deep thinker so convinced of God's unknowability (and yet not, because Wiman ascribes God's hand in everything, including non-Christian religions) casually dismisses evangelical beliefs with poetic flourish while making his own pithy proclamations. I acknowledge the need to muse and ponder freed from the bonds of the Bible, but it is always the anchor that keeps our thoughts in check lest we wander hopelessly off course. For a man so obvious erudite and well-read, I find myself shaking my head at some of the silliness, such as when Wiman approving \"quotes\" the statement attributed to St. Francis that exhorts Christians to \"Go forth and spread the gospel by every means possible. If necessary, use words.\" You'd think a poet would recognize the power of words FOR conversion, for the experience of mystery, not to mention the obvious fact that Jesus Christ did not follow such an admonition when he went about giving the Sermon on the Mount and speaking in parables. As a \"modern believer,\" Wiman's memoir deserves to be read. It is deeply personal and reveals the wrestling that many modern people have who are both drawn to faith and repelled by aspects of traditional religion. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: This is a great review of SF and it's impact on pop culture. It's razor sharp, some of it's views will probably leave you with a sour taste, Disch is very rigid in his reviews of some prominent authors in the field. Still, any reader with a dose of criticism will enjoy this take on SF. His dissection of \"feminist\" and \"military\" SF will be insightful to anyone willing to probe the genre with a clear mind. I must say I was startled at first with some of his views(like the one that the majority of SF is trash) but at the end I must agree with him. He still regards the \"great\" authors as valuable (Heinlein, Dick, Asimov, Clark) but not without flaws. Surely he does not view an author's opus as infallible, e.g. you can't compare the early works of Clarke with some of his last exploits (\"The last theorem\" was rehashed old ideas, and lacking any \"edgy\" ideas). Anyway, I think this book will help any SF lover searching for a critical view of the field, opposed to some other reviews that praise the genre lacking any criticism and cool headed approach. He does have a point when he talks about the SF fandom resembling a sort of introspective group that sees itself as \"above\" the average reader. As does any group that loves to differentiate itself from it's surroundings, creating a false feel of \"uniqueness\". --> No translation was found using the current translator.

Of course it would take a sci-fi nerd who grew up into a SF author (his preferred shorthand) to tell that story. He does so thoroughly from the beginning, claiming Edgar Allen Poe as the genre’s forefather, acknowledging other’s claims that Mary Shelly deserves the title and dismissing it.

            "⚠ Translation error: My only complaint, if we can call it that, about this slim book is that I wish it was longer! This is one of those works where the book's form enacts its content in a literal sense, a concept I really appreciate when done as well as it is here. Hugo Martinez's art possesses a density that many times compelled me to stop and contemplate what I was really looking at. A soothing cup of tea with sugar in London, or the hard legacy of imperialism? A run-of-the-mill hardware store in New York City, or the scene of a deadly 1712 slave revolt? The answer is both, evinced by Martinez's art, in which he embeds illustrations of the past directly into the present. This contributes to a sense of underneath-ness that persists throughout Wake, as in I felt as if I was being offered a generous glimpse beneath not only the stories of enslavement that we typically learn, but also a glimpse underneath how these stories emerge, if they do at all. Unsurprisingly, the archives of enslavement and its revolts are studded with gaps, which complicate Rebecca Hall's endeavors to bring these stories to the page (another hindrance is the casual racism she encounters at libraries and clerk offices along the way), but she widens the angle of the story and invites speculation. She infuses what facts she finds with ruminations on what may have motivated enslaved women to lead these various revolts, embodying the outline of their lives with a fullness that is often tossed aside in favor of historical accuracy. And underneath her own motivations for this kind of storytelling is an ancestral tether—a chorus of voices underneath her own, speaking survival across centuries. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: I started reading Wanderlust the night before I set out to summit a peak in the Dolomites by myself. The weather was dire, and I hiked three hours in the rain, only for the iconic ridgeline-view at the top to be swallowed up by the thickest mist I’ve ever seen. I had expected it, but was determined to go through with it regardless—as an exercise in learning how to walk for the sake of itself, and not for the reward of a destination, a summit, a view. Walking to feel grounded in the landscape, to see how far these feet of mine can carry me, to free up the mind to think. “Walking, ideally, is a state in which the mind, the body, and the world are aligned, as though they were three characters finally in conversation together, three notes suddenly making a chord. Walking allows us to be in our bodies and in the world without being made busy by them. It leaves us free to think without being wholly lost in our thoughts.” Solnit’s ephemeral A Field Guide to Getting Lost was my favorite book I read last year, and I still think about it often. I was hoping that Wanderlust would capture the same unhurried magic, but this earlier non-fiction work is very different: The musings are just as passionate, but much less autobiographical and introspective, and while there are occasional glimpses of her dazzling prose, this was full of quotes by others, and felt much denser and drier due to its broad and rambling scholarly nature. The title tells you precisely what you get: A digressive history of (Western) walking; a meandering exploration of the act as a cultural, social, political, and leisure activity. It is also, now much more so than at the time of publication, a sort of requiem for walking—a practice increasingly excised by an accelerated, car-dependent world. “Thinking is generally thought of as doing nothing in a production-oriented society, and doing nothing is hard to do. It’s best done by disguising it as doing something, and the something closest to doing nothing is walking. Walking itself is the intentional act closest to the unwilled rhythms of the body, to breathing and the beating of the heart. It strikes a delicate balance between working and idling, being and doing. It is a bodily labor that produces nothing but thoughts, experiences, arrivals.” From English gardens to Alpine peaks, from moorlands to suburban cul-de-sacs, from Paris to Las Vegas, from labyrinths to treadmills, Solnit is our guide on a path that traces the evolution of walking from the development of bipedalism to the modern age, via the walks of romantic poets, tourists, pilgrims, fictional characters, philosophers, courting couples, trespassers, flâneurs, jaywalkers, protesters, mountaineers, revolutionaries, and prostitutes. Link your arm with hers and come along for the stroll, but be prepared to cover a lot of ground in a long-winded yet superficial way. As an avid walker-hiker, I had hoped to connect with and like Wanderlust much more than I did, but it was a bit of a slog, and it took me a month to labor through; the occasional compelling thought couldn’t make up for too many dull stretches. “Walking… is how the body measures itself against the earth.” --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: tle recruiting for her agency. And this was in 1950. Impressive and worthy of a place in this anthology. However, I must add a caveat: it is one of the least interesting plots in the anthology, making it a fair to middling story at best. Such a shame. Perhaps something else from Schmitz’s Agent of Vega series would have been better. Second Dawn, by Arthur C. Clarke -- I’ve only read the Clarke stories that everyone’s read -- Rama , 2001 , Childhood’s End -- but I have always been impressed with the sober, literary bent to his work. Thus, it was no surprise to me Second Dawn is one of the best written stories in the anthology. Clarke’s prose is clear, his themes are well expressed, and he manages to conjure one of the most interesting and unique alien species we’ve seen -- the Atheleni -- but there are “buts”, and those “buts” go beyond mere context, which either make the story problematic or even more impressive. My sense is that Second Dawn is actually more problematic than impressive; however, I do think that whichever the story is, it is a perfect story for class discussion (and I am going to adjust my syllabus to add it). I am speaking of two elements that Clarke seems to be uncritically including in his story: a sort of space “Manifest Destiny” and enslavement of an “inferior” race by a “superior” one. The reason I fear that Clarke uncritically added these elements is that his characters are very critical of their ethics when it comes to the use of weapons they’ve developed and their fears for the future. The fact that none of the characters note the other things they are engaged in seems out of joint with what Clarke was explicitly doing. Still, perhaps this is some strategic underspecificity at work? Perhaps it is there for the reader to remark on rather than the characters, and if that was Clarke’s purpose, he succeeded. Crucifixus Etiam, by Walter M. Miller Jr. -- Manue. Manue, Wherefore are you on Mars, Manue? Reject your mission and reclaim your freedom. But nope. That’s not in the indentured cards. Instead, you will suck and suck until your lungs can suck no more, and then you will die long before your purpose is fulfilled. Miller Jr. delivers one of the most existentially rich stories in this anthology. It is full of Christ imagery (you noticed the title, right?), Catholic guilt and duty, religious humanism, hard sci-fi tech, Marxist thought, and despair. It is Earth’s history writ by Ares. What you take from this says much more about you than it does about Miller Jr.’s story. How cool are tales like that? The Tunnel Under the World, by Frederik Pohl -- Pohl hated advertising; he hated psychiatry; he hated propaganda, and he was attacked as a Pinko for his positions. I’m guessing he really was a Commie, and good on him because his body of work is not kind to the Capitalist drive to consume. His novel, Space Merchants , goes even farther than his short story, The Tunnel Under the World , but even in this quick tale of Guy Burckhardt and the horror of his repeating life, Pohl’s disdain for consumerism is at the fore. Couple this attack on consumerism with one of the most original conceptions of AI and Robotics that Sci-Fi has ever seen, then add in one of the best radio adaptations of a Sci-Fi story (track it down at Relic Radio Sci-Fi if you can), and you have one of the most fascinating, thought provoking tales in the entire anthology. But you’ll have to cope with some 50s sexism. Hell ... you can’t have everything. Who Can Replace a Man?, by Brian Aldiss -- Christ, Mr. Aldiss. Something to replace us, please. Anything. A “man” appears in this story in only one sentence, but “man’s” stamp is everywhere. In this, the shortest story in the anthology, mankind has ravaged the Earth in all the ways -- real and imaginary -- that we have lived, are living, or could still live, and we have driven ourselves to the point of extinction, but at least behind us we have left out last slave race -- the robots. And this is their great moment of liberation (or destruction), unless it isn’t. So much being said here in 1958 and a great deal of it is being said by remaining unsaid. Potent and poignant. Billenium, by J.G. Ballard -- This is, actually, one of the less weird stories by one of Sci-Fi’s weirdest authors, yet it still remains a difficult stone to chip for readers. Imagine, if you will, a world of cities and farms. The farms are given over to the most industrial form of agriculture you can imagine (since Ballard d --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",
            "⚠ Translation error: The structure of this “authoritative” collection of science fiction short stories is rigidly chronological, based on when the stories were written. Some of the authors of the older pieces foresaw technology or events that have actually come to pass. The first example of which is H.G. Wells’ “The Land Ironclads,” introducing the usage of tanks into war a full 13 years before they were actually invented. The story was interesting due to the sheer innovativeness of the subject matter, but it was difficult to follow. Wells does not identify the enemy combatants with any kind of national appellation, instead referring to “invaders” and “defenders”, which was rather confusing to me, particularly since it is not readily apparent to which side our narrator belongs. I am also not well-versed in the machinations of war, so found the whole thing rather confounding throughout. “Finis” by Frank L. Pollack was much more my style of story. Our narrator is awaiting the rise of a second sun, which scientists have theorized is located at the center of the universe and the earth is about to rotate into the path of its emanation. What happens is not exactly what the astronomers expected. A fascinating “what if” tale; over too soon. Since I know of Rudyard Kipling almost exclusively in connection with The Jungle Book, I expected his contribution to this collection to be quite different than it turned out to be. In “As Easy as ABC,” set in the far future, the population has become scarce and seems to ascribe the catastrophe that wiped out the previous hordes to the “evils” of “crowds” and “invasion of privacy.” I’m not sure I really understood all the implications or the moral of this story because it took me quite some time to figure out what was going on, and what the “ABC” actually is and does. “The Metal Man” by Jack Williamson was much more comprehensible. Told in a similar style to Verne’s Journey to the Center of the Earth, Burroughs’ A Princess of Mars or Wells’ The Time Machine, our narrator relates a secondhand tale of one who had fantastic experiences in an unworldly place with unfamiliar creatures. The (non)ending left something to be desired as it was rather abrupt, but the story was interesting enough. In the same vein, “A Martian Odyssey” is Stanley G. Weinbaum’s description of an exploratory expedition on Mars. One of the crew is separated from the others and encounters some unfathomable alien creatures, one of which might actually be sentient. I really liked this story, particularly the dialog. It was apparent that the crew was made up of men from several different nationalities, which highlighted the idea that when encountering a foreign being some work has to be done to gain understanding and translation. Another visit to Mars is made by the protagonist of John W. Campbell’s “Night.” Campbell is famous for shaping modern science fiction due to his longtime position as editor of Astounding. His own work tends to be bleak, particularly in this example, in which a man is transported to the last days of the galaxy. Everything is dead or dying and our narrator contemplates the death of the universe and what it might mean that mankind does not survive. The next selection is set one planet more distant. In Clifford D. Simak’s “Diversion,” a team of scientists is trying to adapt the human body for life on Jupiter. They’ve identified the most promising prospect amongst the native fauna and are transmogrifying humans and sending them out as tests. Unfortunately, they’re not coming back. Finally, the project manager must submit himself as a test subject in order to avoid being blamed for more “deaths.” What he finds out about the nature of humanity as opposed to the nature of Jovians is a challenge to anyone’s self-image. The action returns to the more familiar setting of Earth for Lewis Padgett’s “The Piper’s Son,” although it is a post-apocalyptic society we encounter. After the nuclear blasts, a mutation has occurred giving some people the gift of telepathy. The central concern is whether telepathy is a gift or a curse and how one integrates with a society that views one for the most part with suspicion and fear. Almost 20 years later, the X-Men would dwell on this same theme with a similar commentary. As I am partial to social experiments in science fiction, I found this particularly enjoyable. So far, all of the narrators of these stories, even in fantastic alien settings, have been human. A.E. van Vogt chooses to tells us ab --> No translation was found using the current translator.

Kitabın alt başlığındaki gibi \"her şey parçalanırken büyüme\"yi öyle güzel anlatıyor ki, hayranlıkla okudum. Kendisi siyaset bilimi alanında çalışan bir akademisyen olduğu için hem bu büyük toplumsal konuyu mükemmelen çerçeveliyor, hem de özellikle çocukluğunu anlattığı dönemleri yazarken büyük bir maharetle geri dönüp bir çocuğun anlamlandırma ihtiyacını, dünyanın belirsizliğini ve tanımsızlığını mükemmelen hissettirerek yazıyor. Dolayısıyla hem çok akışkan, hem çok derinlikli bir metin çıkıyor ortaya. Aslında sosyalizme dair bir inceleme yazmak niyetiyle başlamış Ypi bu kitaba ancak bunu salt teorik bir çerçeveden, kendi tanıklığını katmadan yazamayacağını anlamış ve kitap bir anı kitabına dönüşmüş, iyi ki de öyle olmuş çünkü bence tanıklığı müthiş kıymetli.

Şu alıntıyla bitireyim: \"Benim ailem sosyalizmi sınırlanmayla eşit sayıyordu: kim olmak istediklerinin, hata yapma ve bu hatalardan öğrenme haklarının, dünyayı kendi koşullarıyla keşfetmelerinin sınırlanmasıyla.

I Fri berättar hon om sin uppväxt, först i ett helt isolerat land där straffet för olovlig utresa är dödsstraff, sen i ett så kallat ”fritt” land med marknadsekonomi och inbördeskrig (pyramidkrisen). Hon är i skrivande stund professor i politisk teori och problematiserar också frihetsbegreppet. Kort sagt: Fri är en fantastisk läsupplevelse och jag instämmer i hyllningskören. Det mest slående med den här berörande och varma autofiktiva uppväxtromanen som förstås tilltalar den som intresserar sig för sydeuropeisk historia, mänsklig existens, frihet och politik är författarens perfekta humor. Som barn är Lea väldigt nöjd med sitt land och sin tillvaro. Alla har samma saker, ingen är utan och alla är fria på riktigt. Hon tycker synd om fattiga som lever i ”väst” för i kapitalistiska länder är ju bara de rika fria. Information om levernet präglat av liberalism får hon via turister (som luktar märkligt – solkräm, förstår hon senare) och svårinställda tv-kanaler. Omslagets röda burk – en eftertraktad inredningsdetalj som ju verkligen inte alla hade – är en slående metafor för den här tiden då få visste hur Coca cola smakade och semestrarna finansierades av partiet. ”Vår lärare Nora hade förklarat att utanför Albanien visste folk inte namnet på den som tillverkade saker, namnen på arbetarna. Hon berättade att i väst kände man bara till namnen på fabrikerna där sakerna tillverkades, människorna som ägde dem och deras barn och barnbarn.” Sen faller regeringen och inifrånskildringen av att leva under kommunistiskt enpartistyre växlar över till en berättelse om kaos och förvirring som omställningsperioden medför. En helt ny begreppsapparat introduceras i takt med att planekonomin raseras. Nu får hon veta vad girighet och avundsjuka är för något. Tidigare fanns det nästan inga varor att köpa även om man hade pengar, nu finns det varor men inga pengar att köpa för. Hennes familj och släkt har burit på hemligheter som nu uppdagas. Så småningom kommer hon i kontakt med konstigheter som vi här tar för givna: bäst-före-datum, bananer, religion, cv, kundvagnar (varför handla mer än man kan bära?), att ha flera personer att välja mellan när man ska rösta. Friheten som kom var dock som en kallnad maträtt man tog några tuggor av, hungern bestod. De som försöker lämna landet blir nämligen tillbakaskickade. ”Väst hade ägnat decennier åt att kritisera öst för dess stängda gränser, bekostat insatser för att kräva rörelsefrihet, fördömt det omoraliska hos stater som inte erkände rätten att ge sig av. Exilalbaner hade tagit emot som hjältar. Nu behandlades de som brottslingar. […] vilket värde har rätten att ge sig av när det inte finns någon rätt att bli mottagen? Var gränser och murar förkastliga enbart när deras syfte var att hålla människor inne till skillnad från när de höll människor ute?” Frågan om vad det innebär att vara fri är filosofisk och låter sig inte lätt besvaras. Hur förhåller sig frihet till människans funktioner och behov, vilja, samhälle och lagar? Jag tycker mycket om Ypis nyanserade funderingar som uppmuntrar läsaren att fundera på vad hon själv tycker. Författaren sätter fingret på direkta och indirekta tvång och hur övergången från socialism till liberalism medför förändrade tankesätt och normsystem. Det första hör samman med solidariska ideal exempelvis har en handikappad person inte sig själv att skylla och en socialist ser som moralisk plikt att kollektivt hjälpa personer i nöd. Det liberalistiska synsättet vars ledord är frihet bereder plats för egoism: det är inte mitt fel att hen är i nöd, tänker man. ”Min familj likställde socialismen med förnekelse: en förnekelse av det de egentligen ville vara, av rätten att göra misstag och lära av dem, att utforska världen på sina egna villkor. Jag jämställde liberalismen med brutna löften, en raserad solidaritet, med rätten att ärva privilegier och blunda för orättvisor.” Mina tankar går till Schopenhauer som påtalade människans bristande förmåga att nöja sig, hennes ständiga jakt: när vi inte har det vi vill ha blir vi frustrerade och när vi har fått det vi vill ha blir vi snabbt uttråkade. Mycket vill ha mer och hur får vi stopp på det? Jag tänker också på Kant som med sin pliktetik lyfter fram att det alltid finns en frihet i ofriheten. ”Vi förlorade aldrig vår inre frihet: friheten att göra det som är rätt.” Vi som lever i högerlandet Sverige i --> No translation was found using the current translator.

Μπορεί το βιβλίο να μην είναι καμία \"σπουδαία λογοτεχνία\", μιας και στόχος της συγγραφέα δεν είναι να καταπλήξει με τις λέξεις της, όμως είναι άκρως ενδιαφέρων ο τρόπος που παραθέτει τις προσωπικές της εμπειρίες, όχι σαν ξερά δεδομένα για το πώς ήταν η ζωή στην Αλβανία την τάδε χρονική στιγμή, αλλά με βιώματα, όπως η ιστορία με το κουτάκι κοκα κόλας. Ποτέ δεν είχα σκεφτεί τόση ώρα για το τι συμβολίζει ένα κουτάκι κοκα κόλας. Μου άρεσε που πουθενά δεν παρατήρησα να είναι η συγγραφέας νοσταλγός του παρελθόντος, όμως διάλεξε να κάνει σπουδές πάνω στην φιλοσοφία του μαρξισμού, με στόχο να δει με κριτική ματιά το καθεστώς στο οποίο μεγάλωσε. Μου άρεσε που είχε δόσεις χιούμορ μέσα σε μια δύσκολη πραγματικότητα και που βίωνε την εφηβεία της ως έναν βαθμό ελεύθερη και ως \"κανονική έφηβη\". “Socialism had succeeded in ripping the veil off women's head, but not in the minds of their men. It had managed to tear chains carrying crosses from their wives' chests, but those chains still shackled their husbands' brains.” --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: Trying to get back into reading is hard. 'Cadence' by Charlotte Nicole Davis 4 stars Deals with grief and gender identities and what makes you 'you'. Well written but I wish it was ever so slightly longer. 'On the Tip of My Tongue' by William Alexander 5 stars I am a sucker for stories in 2nd person. I love that it brought such an ambiguity to the genders of both the narrator and the person they are dictating the story to. I loved the creativity of the title and how its so integral to the plot. I was fully sucked into this story like the coffee sucked into space. 'Melanitis' by Junauda Petrus-Nasah 4 stars As a white woman, I feel I can't accurately rate/have an opinion on this story. However, I found the theory of it awesome. In a world where you can get a \"disease\" to turn black, how would white men react to suddenly being black? I thought it was spot on. These FANs would lobby for rights, not for Black people, but for their own; white men with melanin. I will say the story felt a bit preachy at times; rightfully so, but then the issues with our main character took a backseat. Their gender and hair identity questions didn't seem like the focus. Overall, it was a fantastic premise that I would love to read an actual novel about, but as a short story, didn't seem to fit. 'Extremophiles' by A.R. Capetta 5 stars Maybe its because it combined two of my favorite things (space and oceans) but I really liked this one! The letters were a cute device and while a lot of the sciencey speak made my eyes glaze over, I still felt like I \"got\" it. I love (again) the genderless way of speaking. It makes me feel cozy. I honestly could read books upon books of bored teens in space. 'The Memory of Soil' by Wendy Xu 3 stars A comic! I was super excited but... I don't think I understood it. It's short and alludes to the beginning of an interesting friendship, but ends before I felt like I even got attached to either of the characters. We still don't really know why Astrid is there or what's keeping her in a funk. We don't know why the robot was there. Felt like a prologue to a story that will never happen. 'Walk 153' by K. Ancrum 5 stars My favorite story of them so far. We follow a young man who is working his way through college as a walker; someone who straps a camera to themselves and walks around for homebound people to watch. On one particular walk, his client hacks into his headset and speaks to him. Thus striking up an interesting friendship. It was beautiful and heartbreaking seeing their instant connection. I was truly along for the ride. Wonderful. 'The Weight of a Name' by Nasugraq Rainey Hopson 3 stars Other than the mention of space travel, I don't see how this was sci-fi. Not that it was bad. It was well written and interesting and I was on the edge of my seat to the end to see if they made the deadline. It was interesting to learn about this group of people; those who live in the arctic. However, still confused on how this is sci-fi. 'Twin Strangers' by Elizabeth Bear 2 stars Another one that didn't seem very sci-fi, just high school drama. They don't explain what the 'dops' are very well, but I assume its like an AI clone of yourself, a doppelganger. Our main character's betrays him by ratting out his best friend for cheating. Liam also struggles with an eating disorder that's never discussed. I did not feel for Liam nor did I care for the drama at all. 'The Cage' by E.C. Myers 4 stars I like the idea of parallel universes because in one of them, maybe I'm a publish author. Anyway, this follows the transcripts and recordings of two misfit kids as they attempt to jump universes. One of them disappears and the other attempts to follow suit. This is all in the frame of a true crime podcast reporting about the first missing kid. Interesting premise that fairly delivers. I really liked the end where they discuss that each person's CHIP is individual and the two recovered missing kids have two different CHIPS... proving the parallel universe theory correct despite the skepticism the podcast host has. Really enjoyed. 'Smile River' by A.S. King 3.5 stars Scary how I could see this being our future. This is a story that spans many generations. Rose 2051 is the daughter of a man who invented permanent smiles for women; then removal of their feelings as well. Next is Rose 2100 who feels way too much but can't. And Rose 2150 who is going to save them all by changing the algorithm. It ends before she can achieve her goal, but I thin --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: The Very Best of Fantasy & Science Fiction: Sixtieth Anniversary Anthology is an excellent collection of 23 stories picked from the treasure trove of short fiction that's been published in the eponymous magazine over the past 60 years. Editor Gordon Van Gelder — also the editor of the magazine since 1997 — has done an admirable job, picking stories that illustrate the diversity of both the genre and the magazine. As such, this is a great anthology for SF&F fans as well as newcomers looking for a taste. The line-up of authors in this collection looks like a veritable Who's Who of speculative fiction: Ray Bradbury, Philip K. Dick, Stephen King, Roger Zelazny, Ursula K. Le Guin, Neil Gaiman — just to name a few of the most famous ones. What's even more impressive is the fact that all the stories collected here saw their first publication in the magazine. It really gave me pause when I realized that a towering classic such as \"Flowers From Algernon\" by Daniel Keyes first appeared in this digest-sized magazine (and if you haven't read that story yet, you have at least one perfect reason to get this anthology right now!). Every story is preceded by a brief and thoughtful editorial note, often highlighting its author's involvement with the magazine. The quality of these stories is, as could be expected, almost uniformly excellent. Stand-outs for me were: the previously mentioned \"Flowers For Algernon\" which is about a mentally retarded man who gains a brief period of brilliance via a scientific experiment; \"Solitude\" by Ursula K. Le Guin, an exquisite and touching story set in her Hainish Cycle; \"Creation\" by Jeffrey Ford, about a young boy's attempt to create life; and \"Mother Grasshopper\" by Michael Swanwick, about how a far-future civilization becomes reintroduced to death. If I could give these stories individual ratings, they'd all have five stars by their names, with the majority of the others getting a solid four stars. The only disappointment for me was \"Buffalo\" by John Kessel, a reverie about a fictional meeting between the author's father and H.G. Wells. By the numbers: out of the 23 stories collected here, I'd call 12 solidly science fiction, 6 definitely fantasy, 1 horror, and the rest hard to place but trending towards the fantastical. Included in that last category is Harlan Ellison's \"The Deathbird\", which is more or less a genre of its own and one of the oddest things I've read in years. The stories are spread out across the six decades of the magazine's existence, although strangely enough not a single story from the eighties was included. The earlier part of the anthology is predominantly science fiction, and as fantasy became more popular over the years, more stories of that genre appear towards the end of the collection. The only real \"high fantasy\" story included here is Peter S. Beagle's \"Two Hearts,\" in which the author revisits his classic The Last Unicorn. In terms of length, the stories vary from barely 3 pages (Neil Gaiman's \"The Others,\" a terrifying vision of hell) to Stephen King's 44 page story \"The Gunslinger,\" one of the 5 stories that make up the novel of the same name, originally serialized in the magazine. Another number, and one that might raise an eyebrow, is 5: the number of female authors represented here, compared to 18 male authors. Also, some readers may look for one or more legendary stories from the magazine that unfortunately aren't represented here. My personal pick would be to add Fritz Leiber's \"Ill Met in Lankhmar\" novella, originally published in F&SF Magazine and certainly one of its classic — and now sadly underappreciated — stories. Still, it's easy to second-guess almost any anthology, let alone one that attempts to span the life of one of the most revered magazines in speculative fiction. When all's said and done, this is undeniably an excellent collection of stories — one that will give readers a great look at the history of F&SF Magazine and, in doing so, the history of the entire genre. It's possible that some reader will already be familiar with many of these stories, but if you aren't, The Very Best of Fantasy & Science Fiction: Sixtieth Anniversary Anthology is practically a must-read. Highly recommended. This review was also published on the Fantasy Literature website: http://www.fantasyliterature.com/zzas... --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: I read the reviews of Livy's History and I see that his writing has been badly misunderstood. Critics make two charges against it; one worthless, and one worthwhile. The first is that Livy is reliant on myth and miraculous stories. He includes tales that are not possibly true, or have been pilfered from the Greeks. They complain also that Livy is too credulous about fantastic occurrences like, for example, when he observes talking cows or phenomenal weather. But this charge is frankly stupid. It is preposterous to expect of ancient historians sensibilities that are modern. And, in any case, it presumes to judge what is the method best equipped for recounting a political story. This entry then will waste no more time answering charges of this sort. They do not deserve the dignity of a reply, let alone a serious one. There is however a second criticism of Livy, one that must be answered. It says that Livy's History is flat; it is shaped to read as \"And then... And then... And then...\", one consul after another, and has no arc or great complication that it builds to. Livy, they say, is giving epic history, but without epic form. And by that reason his History is boring. It is tedious and dull, and at times almost admittedly so--when, for example, Livy emphasizes \"once again\" the Aequians and the Volscians are pillaging the Roman hinterland, since such, like his History, are routine in pattern. This criticism is partly right, but mostly wrong. I concede his History is arranged in unepic form, but this is by design, not by accident. And when one reflects upon it, it's usage is actually quite ingenious. If one wants to read the Rise of Rome, you must turn to Polybius. This is where Rome's rise as such is given in the classic history. Not however with Livy. His is the History of the Republic of Rome. They are different--the Rise and the Republic. And where the first might require epic arrangement, the second does not. Instead Livy has organized his narrative as a montage. The origin and life of Romulus, for example, is really a collection of unrelated accounts, but each to a purpose. First there is the story of Romulus's and Remus's adolescence; then their revenge against a wicked king; then the foundation of Rome and Remus's death; then a comparison between Hercules and Romulus; then the abduction of Sabine women; then the betrayal of a Roman fort by Tarpeius's daughter; then the intervention of Sabine women; and finally Romulus's strange disappearance. The narrative here does not aggregate into something larger. Though it progresses with time, each is a story of its own, adjoined only by the coincidence of their Roman association. This technique of story-making is distinctive. And readers may be wrongly expecting from Livy qualities of the larger Roman genre of history that is dominated by the Polybian style. In Tacitus, in Gibbon--there you see the epic form of history told. The question then should not be why Livy went wrong in his recount. That question, I have just argued, is a misapprehension of his History. Instead the question should be what motive Livy had to write the way that he did? Why the anti-epic? Was it a repudiation of Caesarian politics? Was Livy nostalgic for the Republic? Was it that he wanted to designify the great moments in their relation to the little? Did he want to elevate the ordinary travails of republican life to the level of the extra-ordinary? Or was his meaning purely moral? And does the History figure then only as a stage on which to portray the famous life lessons of Roman virtue? These are questions to which I have not the answer. But they are questions that are fair to ask. And those who wait for Livy to ascend to lofty themes rather than attend to the small, will have had an experience similar to having heard something without listening to it. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: This book has been in my sights since I finished Gibbon; but I was wary of beginning another interminably long history series. Luckily, as I soon discovered, Livy is a lucid and engaging writer, so the reader has little need to fear getting bogged down, as one sometimes does with Gibbon. As one might expect, the English and the Roman historians are worlds apart. Livy is almost exclusively a dramatic historian; and the book often feels quite like a novel. There is little attempt at analysis. Nor is Livy drawn to the vaguer sort of philosophical moralizing that historians sometimes indulge in. The closest that Livy gets to analysis is in his speeches. As in Thucydides, Livy puts long orations into the mouths of his principle characters, all of which are pure fabrications. For the most part these speeches are dramatic devices, allowing us to see why the Romans acted in a certain way; but the reader often notes the opinion of Livy himself creeping into these orations—the historian’s strong sense of what is right and proper for Romans to do. Of course we poor Anglophones can only guess at the true merit of these compositions, as Livy is considered to be one of the great Latin stylists. Even with much of the rhetorical beauty stripped away, however, they are rousing pieces. Livy’s stated aim in writing his history was to escape his degraded present into a glorious past. A thoroughgoing Republican, he mourned the birth of the Empire, though he did see why a strong hand was needed amid the political chaos of recent years. The result is a kind of prose poem, a sequel to Virgil’s epic, telling the heroic story of Rome’s rise from a small city-state to a world power. Livy explains this ascent like a true patriot: as the consequences of a particularly Roman virtue, a manly courage and intelligence which saw the Roman people through innumerable obstacles. Dominion is the only fitting reward. These first five books cover the city’s mythical founding by Romulus up to the sacking of the city by the Gauls, in 390 BCE. During this time the monarchy gave way to the republic, which soon found itself embroiled in a thousand wars, big and small, with Rome’s neighbors on the Italian peninsula. The annalistic recounting of the elections of tribunes and consuls, the battles fought and won, can get tiresome at times. More interesting, to me, were the conflicts between the patricians and the plebeians—a proto-Marxist story of class conflict. In general, Livy’s eye turns to wherever there is turmoil; and the final impression is of an endless battle. One wonders whether the Romans are doing anything else, such as farming or trading or making music. As with any ancient historian, Livy falls far short of the accuracy and transparency that is expected of modern historians. And since he is a patriotic writer, this is doubly true. Even so, this is a tremendously valuable historical document, and a thrilling read to boot. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

This is one true House of Horrors, perhaps the best one ever orchestrated (maybe discounting Poe). Yes, EVER. The prose is so simple, so readable, that the barest of essentials are there, in all their power & glory: the haunted house, the victim-lover, the victimizer/lover, the clandestine meetings, the haunted past, the switch-over of protagonists, the uncertainty caused by one elegant overflow of optical illusions, the Victorian conventions all intended to spook the hell out of a reader that's totally in awe of the way a classic story can be so expertly conveyed. Both this & \"Dracula\" are revolutionary in that uberentertaining way in which the plot is given to us: through letters & witness accounts. Yes, the only way to be frightened is to have the monster in the backdrop, a perpetual threat that's under the velvet curtain. It is truly, TRULY (I want to scream out my window!) delicious-- how nobody from the Paris Opera knows exactly what the phantom looks like, how they all put up their own fears projected unto the myth (who, I must admit, is a true turn-of-the-century bad-ass-- a Micheal Myers combined with Hannibal Lecter... you must meet this version-- he's a more maniacal and romantic phantom than the musicals!). I could not ask for more in a book, its brevity is bittersweet (you wish there were more details, more certainties... this effect, of course, is genius); its use of freak show conventions are all aligned beautifully. This is a masterpiece to be savored! (Read it to your cool kid or niece/nephew!) UPDATE: just caught the show this last Wednesday night (9/7/16) at the Buell. No musical is as technically rich as this one (which is SO like the Phantom himself). It IS the decade of the 80s-its very opulent (quint)essence! And this is the decade of my birth...

            "⚠ Translation error: This will be a review of contradictions. First of all, it is an excellent story with interesting characters and a well-designed plot. Odysseus would be proud of the characters' journey. The book is very well written and edited. The author did an excellent job incorporating religion, history, and mythology. There is plenty of action, suspense, and mystery. That being said, I found the book extremely dense and wordy. The author clearly has a love of words and must have an impressive vocabulary. Either that, or he owns the world's most well-worn thesaurus. On its own, that isn't a bad thing. But in a 900+ page e-book (with my e-reader settings), it gets old. Here is a (less egregious) example: The author wrote \"A mellifluous susurration accompanied the stink, a singsong murmur....\" In context, the sentence could have easily read: \"A melodic gurgle accompanied the stink...\" or any number of variations. I found myself skimming whole pages and never felt like I missed anything. In truth, if I had not committed to reviewing the book, I would probably not have finished it. So why still give it four stars? Because technically and artistically, it is very good. There's nothing wrong with it. In fact, it is one of the most well-written books I've read in a long time. It just felt like a chore to read rather than a nice break from the world, like a college humanities class assignment. Even so, it was still worth finishing.

            "⚠ Translation error: steel yourself against him—whereas one has no trouble rejecting a being that looks like a zombie. They say the Devil can disguise himself as an angel of light, and that’s just what he did here. (Leroux hints sometimes in the book that there might be something diabolical about Erik, similar to insinuations Emily Brontë makes about Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights ). But on the other hand (to quote Tevye from Fiddler on the Roof , probably the greatest character to ever grace a Broadway stage), many viewers won’t—and haven’t—perceived it that way. Instead they make excuses for him: “It’s his horrible childhood!” “He only kills because no one loved him!” “Christine could have changed him!” And they have a point. We are, after all, talking about a man whose earliest memory is of his mother handing him a mask so she wouldn’t have to look at his face. Leroux says nothing more than that; the freak show is a Lloyd-Webber invention, and a good one (it also offers a far more satisfactory reason for Erik’s alliance with Madam Giry than that given by the novel). That Erik—again, like Heathcliff—was abused and damaged, is doubtless. But the same could be said of Quasimodo (another book I have to read sometime) and he turned out the opposite. It’s an explanation but not an excuse. As for Christine, she did change him, in both the book and the play/movie, by showing him compassion when he needed it most. In the book, the horror of his proposal goes unmixed, while the musical has her heart torn in two different directions, between a good man who would die for her and a bad, broken, sympathetic man who would kill for her. In another timeline, where different choices were made, I hope that Erik and Christine were able to make a life together. As is, she made the only reasonable choice his actions allowed her to make. WHERE IS THE PERSIAN?!? Well, Lord Andrew? Why did you write out one of the book’s most interesting characters? The book has some disturbing violence in the Phantom’s torture chamber (yes, he has one), where Raoul and the Persian might die of heat exhaustion if they don’t despair of finding the hidden door and hang themselves first. Also, the Phantom’s got enough explosives down there to blow the Opera House to kingdom come, which he threatens to do many, many times. He also strangles quite a few people with his Punjab lasso. A lot of his illusions are terrifying, though none so horrid as his own poor face. Teens and up. The movie contains one scene of highly disturbing violence. Erik finds out that a stage hand was spreading rumors about his disfigurement, stalks the guy in the rafters of the stage, throttles him, and hangs the corpse so it falls on the stage. He also drops a giant chandelier on a packed house. The stage musical supposedly has almost no sexual content. The movie doesn’t have anything terribly racy either, but apparently the screen Phantom pets Christine more than his stage equivalent does, and her outfits show a wee bit more skin than the stage costumes tend to. Should be fine for teens, but judge for yourselves if it’s okay for younger kids. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: I read this book after reading Book #3 (Cyanide With Christie). I enjoyed both books and will continue with the series. There were only a few problems with some of the characters, unfortunately the main ones. Emily Cavanaugh, a widow and college professor, has inherited much of her great aunt's estate, including a Victorian mansion and several rental properties. On checking out the mansion, she returns to her hometown and finds that the sheriff is her high-school sweetheart and the love of her life, who disappeared from her life after high school. More than 30 years have gone by, but after explanations of their separation, they have rekindled their romance. I think my main problem with these two characters is that I don't really think they are compatible. Emily is a well-read, well-educated woman, and seems to sometimes condescend to the sheriff when he doesn't know who an author is, or the definition of a word she uses. The character Marguerite is also annoying, mostly because she speaks French so often, with few translations given, even though the reader is told that she can speak perfect English. All that said, I do enjoy the stories, and I will continue reading the series. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

Ideology in this book definitely speaks to me at this stage of my life. This book is not related to religious ideologies or promotes any of them of balanced life. That hooked me, because at this part of my life, I do not want to associate having a peaceful life with religious reasoning - and this book was exactly this.

            "⚠ Translation error: I approached this book with an open mind, curious about different perspectives. I have always been fascinated by religions, philosophies, and perspectives which differ from mine. Dr. Turmel presents this book in a very calculated and cerebral way. I'm not certain if I'm on board with the proposed idea that our bodies are a separate entity from our soul which can be controlled by stowaway or passenger entities which exist inside our bodies. It's an interesting concept and he explains it in depth, but it's quite disconcerting. Perhaps that's part of the appeal of this book. With several layers within the text regarding philosophy, cosmology, and theology, there's something here for anyone who wishes to explore who they are and why. This was a book which I needed to set down to work through what I'd read, then pick it back up again. It certainly was not a quick read in one sitting. I did find it quite dry and often times repetitive, but it was well-written with proper grammar. I enjoyed the fact that Dr. Turmel did not shy away from hard questions such as \"Does God exist?\" nor from hard answers. He challenged conventionally held beliefs using logic without being pedantic. Overall, I found this dive into the \"Outsider\" model to be interesting even if it isn't something I necessarily believe to be true. It did make me consider questions I hadn't before. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

Sherlock doesn't meet Cthulhu or Batman or Donald Trump, so these are good things. I do, however, think that it does go a touch too Hollywood. The cameos are fun, but in a slim volume, it does begin to feel a touch claustrophobic, a touch overstuffed. Still, with no new Doyle yarns, Meyer is, at least for now, still my favourite go-to for the further adventures of Holmes and Watson. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

Nicholas Meyer hat noch zwei Sherlock Holmes Bücher geschrieben (Sherlock Holmes und das Phantom der Oper & Sherlock Holmes und Sigmund Freud), die ich auch besitze. Ich habe die Bücher seit ziemlich genau 25 Jahren und fand alle damals super. Ich habe in den letzten zwei Jahren alle drei Bücher malwieder gelesen und kann nur sagen... Das hier ist das einzige von den dreien, das der Zeit standgehalten hat. Ich liebe es immer noch. Vor allem, weil der Fall an sich bzw. die Auflösung für mich immer noch wahnsinnig mitreißend und unendlich tragisch ist. Und sehr heldenhaft. Ja, eigentlich selbstverschuldet, aber für mich hundertprozentig nachvollziehbar auf allen Ebenen. Ich glaube, ich habe noch nie so bedauert, dass ein Buch so geendet hat wie es endet. Es liest sich auch tatsächlich wie eine Sherlock Holmes Buch von Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Ich weiß zwar nicht, was Oscar Wilde und Bram Stoker darin zu suchen haben - ich bin mir nichtmal sicher, ob es George Bernard Shaw wirklich gebraucht hätte, und der bringt den Fall eigentlich erst ins Rollen - aber, ja. Nimmt man eben einfach so mit. Es geht ja schließlich um das Londoner West End und die zu der Zeit dort befindlichen Berühmtheiten. Es hätte definitiv länger sein können und ich hätte mir die medizinische Seite vielleicht noch etwas ausführlicher gewünscht, aber davon abgesehen kann ich das Buch wirklich nur empfehlen. (Mit den anderen beiden Büchern würde ich allerdings nicht mehr meine Zeit verschwenden, es sei denn ihr mögt euren Raoul de Chagny noch waschlappiger als er normalerweise eh schon ist (es sei denn, er wird von Hadley Fraser gespielt) und findet es völlig okay, dass das Phantom jemand komplett anderes ist als im Musical bzw. im Originalroman von Gaston Leroux. Und es sei denn ihr findet es in Ordnung, dass Nicholas Meyer offensichtlich ein Gründungsmitglied im Club „Gebt-Sherlock-Holmes-eine-Frau-das-ist-die-Lösung-für-alles“ ist.

            "⚠ Translation error: When I read At Last A Life , it totally changed my life with its unorthodox (or so I thought) approach to anxiety that actually worked. It didn’t contain the usual exhortations that I just needed to eat right, meditate and be mindful and then my anxiety would be ‘managed’. Instead it just had some very simple advice: stop trying to get better, let the suffering wash over you, stop fearing your own fear, and let your body heal itself. Little did I know that Dr. Claire Weekes had actually figured all of this out back in the 60s! If I had have read this book first, it would have blown my mind and put my whole world to rights, in much the way that David’s book did, because it contains all the same principles. But this book is actually better, and is what I’d recommend to people from now on, because she is actually a doctor, and it appears she was the pioneer of the ideas that David’s book (and perhaps many others) subsequently built upon. I had no idea that she is considered a pioneer of anxiety treatment and that her books have actually been runaway bestsellers. How is it that I had never heard of them, and that none of her work ever found me when I was madly casting around for help with anxiety? It’s a real shame. But no matter – I was put onto it by a review of the recently released title The Woman Who Cracked the Anxiety Code: the extraordinary life of Dr Claire Weekes , which I also plan to read. And even though I am doing fine these days, I still enjoyed reading this book. So: if you have anxiety, read this book!

            "⚠ Translation error: Overwhelming terror may be the closest we ever get to the feeling of being born. Jason Zinoman knows how to tell a compelling story, and he has some great ones to tell, about the lives of the men behind the iconic horror movies of the 1970s and how those movies came into being. Zinoman is a journalist specialising in theatre. One of the most interest aspects of the book is the way he explains the influence of the theatre of Harold Pinter, Edward Albee and Samuel Beckett on some of the writers and directors of classic 1970's horror films, particularly through the concept that the unexplained is far more unnerving than that which can be given a rational context. Films like Night of the Living Dead , Rosemary's Baby , Last House on the Left , The Exorcist , The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , Carrie , Halloween and Alien where the product of commercial considerations, imaginative expressions of personal anxieties and philosophical conflicts as well as arguments in an ongoing debate about how to best go about scaring audiences. By the late sixties, horror in the cinema had become associated with the cosily gothic or campy and with men in bad monster suits. The easing up of censorship in the U.S. with a new ratings system coincided with the entry into the movie business of a bunch of serious horror fans inspired by E.C. comics and the stories of H.P. Lovecraft. There ideas on how to transfer the feelings of dread they loved to the big screen differed. Some, like Wes Craven, believed in unflinching depiction of realistic violence. Others, like Roman Polanski in Rosemary's Baby and John Carpenter in Halloween believed that what was suggested was far scarier than what was shown. (Yet, Polanksi and Carpenter would both later resort to explicit gore in Macbeth and The Thing respectively.) Some, like Kim Henkel, co-writer of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , felt that a sense of gritty realism in setting was crucial to getting the audience to take the story seriously, while Brian De Palma deliberately downplayed the realism when adapting Stephen King's novel Carrie , turning it from the story of an overweight unattractive girl in a realistic high school to that of a strangely beautiful girl in the kind of high school full of beautiful people which only exists in movies. Both approaches worked. The auteur theory encourages us to view movies as the personal expression of their director. While this is appropriate where a director has had almost total control over the proceedings, as with Ingmar Bergman or Federico Fellini, it is misleading in most cases because film-making is a collaborative process which is not in anyone's total control. Zinoman does a great job of showing how films like The Exorcist and Alien were the product of competing viewpoints. William Peter Blatty, as a Catholic, wanted The Exorcist to be an expression of faith. William Friedkin, the director, was an agnostic who was more interested in leaving the existence of God and the Devil more enigmatic. The film which was originally released was closer to Friedkin's vision. Blatty was not happy, but in 2000 he got his wish and the film was re-released in a version which re-instated some of the dialogue which underlined the religious theme of the movie as well as his less ambiguous ending. Dan O'Bannon, who co-wrote the script for alien, had a good deal of influence on the making of the film, being able to persuade the producers to hire controversial artist H. R. Giger to design the alien, however he was kicked off of the set when he kept insisting that director Ridley Scott was pacing the film too slowly. Also, Walter Hill changed O'Bannon's script to make it leaner and to make the main character a woman. The brilliance of the final film comes from the fact that the visions of O'Bannon, Giger, Hill and Scott all fed into it. Sometimes this kind of process leads to a watering down, but sometimes it leads to something which is greater than the contributor's individual visions. There are loads of juicy stories about how the personal lives of these men fed into their work.

Here in the second volume of the New 52's reboot of Detective Comics the creator tells a boring, bland story that does nothing to capitalize on the hype surrounding the book. The Mr. Toxic story is not entertaining at all. The Two-Face backup was extremely boring. There are a lot of issues collected to here but literally nothing happens of note. Daniel's art is still wonderful but it can't overcome the lack of story. Overall, a snoozefest. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: This volume was a better overall package than the first volume because of the tie-in with Scott Snyder's Batman series. (Which is the better of the current Batman books) And so, as much as I enjoyed this installment of Detective Comics, I could not recommend it to those who plan on following one Batman series. If you want a dosage of Batman, go with Scott Snyder's series. However, if you can't get enough of Batman books, then you are doing yourself a disservice by skipping this series. Tony Daniels' artwork is some of the medium's best, and he's perfect for this series because Detective Comics is a horror book. Tony Daniels' art is dark and ghastly. And so are his stories. This book is mostly a collection of standalone stories and my favorite stories were \"The Final Lesson\" and \"The Abyss\" 4/5 stars. If I wasn't comparing this to Snyder's series, I might have given it an extra star. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

I adore Charlaine Harris's novels and the show is one of my favourites, but this is juts a really silly lame story. The art work is supposed to look like the actors, but isn't quite right, they should have just got them to pose in a photo-story type way. Part of the plot is that the bad monster feeds of shame, so the main characters (who are all inexplicably in Merlotte's at the same time apparently between seasons 2 and 3, but isn't Bill missing at this point?) tell their most shameful stories. These stories are not really very juicy (Jason shagged one of his teachers, blah blah). Some of the stories aren't even really stories, or even shameful. Part of the problem is that the background and personality of the some of the characters belongs to Charlaine Harris, and I think only she would be able to do justice to a real flashback type story.

            "⚠ Translation error: So, this story begins on a rainy night in Louisiana. An evil spirit, and Imp Shaloop, comes to Merlotte's and traps the staff and patrons. It is an old Choctaw spirit that eats souls with evil thoughts. He calls himself Ted and requires all of the patrons to tell the most shameful secret about themselves before he will let them go. Sookie, Eric, Tara, Sam, Lafayette, and Jason willingly tell their stories. Bill is the last to tell his. But the spirit is a trickster whose real purpose is to take revenge on Eric because Eric refused to help the trickster spirit's mother when the spirit begged for help. The spirit also kills a number of the patrons in Merlotte's including the girl who was Jason's date. But since the characters killed by Ted, in the Star Trek terminology, are all \"red shirts\", we don't really miss them. There deaths just serve to ramp up the sense of danger. After the trickster collects all the stories, he forces Eric to feel all the emotions he collected which is very hard on a vampire. Then he lets them go. But Eric sticks around to talk to Sookie about something he really fears - a crazy vampire that he thought Godric had staked. Then the book ends on that cliffhanger. The story was interesting and had some backstory about our favorite characters that help make them more well-rounded people. The full-color art was well-done. The characters mostly look like they do on the television show. I did have trouble recognizing Tara in a couple of the frames.

There is one notable big change beyond the backstory though. As anyone who has seen the original episode knows, the last minute may be one of the most heartbreaking scenes in the entire series, as Harley who has been beaten and broken, stuck in bandages and casts, finally realizes what a monster the Joker truly is, receives a “get well soon” card and falls back into the abusive relationship. Here we’re given a much happier ending this time, based on more recent developments in the comics. That may not sit well with all fans, but personally after seeing Harley fall so many times, it was nice to see her get back up. . Overall this book is a wonderful take on the story; filled with winks and nods to fans, while still being accessible to all.

All the stuff about her family, and growing up, and more in-depth view of her falling in love with the joker was great!! However, while the book obviously wasn’t afraid of making changes to the story, near the end it became word for word from the comic/episode without any insight or new detail and became incredibly boring. Also didn’t care for the new ending. Great beginning and middle, end felt rushed and forced. Still recommend if you’re a lover of Harley!

            "⚠ Translation error: I had to temper my expectations on this one, as I went into it thinking it was going to be very much horror with a little satire along the lines of Scream , when it was actually much more dark comedy and slapstick like Scary Movie . What I liked: - Each chapter title being a horror movie rule: so fun! - The MC Charley was both funny and relatable, while she has the horror movie smarts she's just super unco and not the most athletic (running from the killer whilst lamenting her missed P.E. classes as she's huffing and puffing did make me chuckle). - The overly gory deaths were great and just that bit over the top enough that they ranged from disgusting to hilarious, and back again. - The Killer. I did work it out but I didn't fully have the motive down and I thought it was goooood, so it was good pay off. What I didn't like: - Dumb adults everywhere, forcing the teens to have to do all the adulting and solving. I know this is a standard trope in Y.A. but it was bordering on ridiculous here. - The horror hommages were not as subtle and clever as they could have been, Charley and her best friend Olive basically just name-drop several horror movies and franchises every chapter without actually being clever about it or using those references to subvert expectations. - The humour. I wanted to like it but it was just too over the top, and as I mentioned earlier, moved this one from Scream territory right into Scary Movie silliness. What The : - Charley refers to Heathers as underrated... uhh, I think you mean the cult classic Heathers , Charley, come on now. Overall, this was a fun read but definitely aimed more at younger readers, or the uninitiated when it comes to horror. Older readers and horror fans may find it just a bit too silly. 3.5 stars.

            "⚠ Translation error: This was was one the of the main books that we read in my Comics and Graphic Novel class (I've just realized I keep changing around the order of those words and now I can't remember which is correct :D).  Also keep in mind that I'm not an artist, but I am interested in writing comics at some point so this review is from a writer's perspective. Making Comics is around 200 pages, and a book of that size normally doesn't take me long to read. But my professor had us reading the book in sections over the whole term. Looking back I'm not sure if I would have liked Barry's book more or less if I had been able to read it at my normal speed. Barry takes us on a journey though her ideas of making comics, and what she usually does in her classes.  Which at first I found to be quite interesting. It's easy to follow and Barry has a fun style of art. Though honestly her classes seem a little intense and I don't know that I would like being in one. My main problem was that the book quickly becomes repetitive in its exercises and doesn't get to the actual ''making'' of comics until about halfway through. And by the time she actually got to this part I was uninterested.  To me it felt like Barry spent the first half of her book just trying to prove to the readers that her art style was valid, so that by the time she got around to explain how to make comics I just wanted to throw the book away. At the end of the book I wanted to have a clearer idea of what making comics looked like and I don't feel like I had that. I don't think Barry did what she set out to do. I think she got distracted and defensive.  Hence my rating of 2 stars.  The book needed a clearer purpose, or maybe a different title so that I went into it with different expectations. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

Barry does a great job at reminding you how fun it was to draw as a kid, and how to do that again. There are a lot of great exercises to loosen you up and get you past that ever-present hurdle of “what should I draw? But will it look good?” I can tell this is geared toward people who have never considered themselves good at drawing, or haven’t drawn in a long time, and not necessarily for intermediate or advanced artists. But what’s also great about this book is that Barry erases those boundaries between skill levels. If you ask a class of beginners and masters to draw something with their eyes closed, suddenly everyone is on the same level. I think a lot of these are also geared towards classroom or group settings, which is too bad because I would have loved to do those activities.

This novel captures the essence of every parent's deepest fears. As a parent of a 2-year-old, I can honestly say that EV Knight has tapped into the darkest corners of my mind, pulling out the very nightmares that haunt every mother—the ones we keep locked away in the depths of our souls. From the very first page, this novel had me completely hooked. I found myself stealing every spare moment to read—whether I was making lunch, on work breaks, walking somewhere, or even in the shower—I had to know what would happen next. It’s been a long time since a book has pulled me in like this one did. By the end, I was left picking my jaw up off the floor, staring into the abyss as I reflected on what I had just read. Having experienced postpartum depression, I deeply appreciated how EV Knight weaved that aspect into a haunted house horror story. It was done tastefully, without being over the top, making it all too easy to step into the protagonist’s shoes. This novel will stick with me for a long time creeping in from the corner of my mind to remind me to check on my son, or give him a hug… or maybe avoid Alexa?!

Just paid someone to come care for the yard and keep a fresh coat of paint on it.” “That’s sad,” Emily said. “This beautiful place with no one inside to care about it?” p19 This book doesn't score very high in the ratings systems, but I honestly think it deserves a higher score. It's not very scary in the haunted house sense, but there is a great deal of friction resulting from the main characters' relationship and interpretations of their shared experiences. The writing is empathetic of the characters and readers, and the main conflict is compelling because of it. The shape of the plot / primary conflict gets fuzzy at times, but I was invested and excited to read to the end. This book does a lot of the small things right, too, like natural-sounding dialogue, distinction between POVs, and solid pacing. I definitely recommend this book to fans of house horror and domestic thrillers, as this is the perfect blend of these genre, and family drama stories, pregnancy horror, and emotional endings. Reading Notes Three (or more) things I loved: 1. That little bit about the cattleprod and the earthworms? Completely genius horror. 2. I love how exact this book gets about gynecological science. 3. I loved the resolution to the main conflict. It could disappoint some readers though. 4. A very interesting look at abuse in marriages. He's sweet and he never knows what he does that makes her so mad. But from her side, he's controlling and uses his affection toward those ends, and he does know how his behavior is wrong because she tells him. It makes for dynamics way more terrifying than the house they moved into! Three (or less) things I didn't love: This section isn't only for criticisms. It's merely for items that I felt something for other than \"love\" or some interpretation thereof. 1. This story isn't complex enough to justify the use of multiple POVs. Miles's sections don't offer much insight into the story. His character details could be transmitted from Emily's perspective. *edit In the end, I think this perspective brings a lot to the story. 2. I feel bad for Emily, but there isn't enough depth for me to connect with and care about her or her whiny husband. 3. Not a fan of mom magic and superhero-mom tropes. But she might be using these tropes in a metafiction sense, where she is judging these tropes through her story. But I don't think so. I think she reserved these energies to expose the motivations of her characters. 4. The plot is everywhere. Don't get me wrong, it's there. But it doesn't seem to be this story's primary concern.

I was a huge fan of wrestling in the 90s. I watched religiously with my brother. It was kind of our thing to bond over. I remember Al Snow wasn't considered a top talent but he himself was a very talented wrestler (in my opinion at least). This book gives us a peek behind the curtain of the WWE and what it's like amongst the mayhem. He also talks about the hardships of being on the road and the impact it had on the wrestlers mentally, physically and in the personal lives. He really goes into great detail about that subject. If you love wrestling and want an honest no holds barred look into their world during the time of the Al Snows tenure, then I highly suggest picking up a copy of this book when it's released.

            "⚠ Translation error: 4 stars short review for busy readers: A surprisingly good anthology of 9 folk horror stories with uniformly high-quality writing, even if the strongest stories in plot/concept are towards the front. Some gore, but not much. Lots of organic/ecological horror. Ranges from dark fantasy, over New Weird to Grimm Brothers' style nursery rhyme creep. This is the first in a series of three volumes (to date). in detail: First a definition of Folk Horror from the book: At its heart, this highly subjective subgenre of Horror is weird fiction firmly rooted in European pagan tradition—with superstition, folklore, belief, and modernity clashing in ill-omened and menacing ways. I'm not sure all of the stories in this anthology fit that definition, but at least half of them are well worth a read for fans of the creepy who don't go in for the slasher stuff. I very much enjoyed it. Here is a run down of the individual stories with ratings: Sire of the Hatchet: (5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐) A very creepy medieval-esque tale of two executioners coming to a backwood village to squeeze a confession of baby murder from a young girl before executing her. Once there, they can't quite believe their eyes as to the reality of the case and of the village itself. Back along the Old Track (4 stars⭐⭐⭐⭐) a modern story of a holidaymaker in a small village in England who inadvertently witnesses the problems his inbreed farmer neighbours are having with one of their recently deceased. \"They don't die right\" is an understatement! The Fruit (5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐) Holy crap, I don't think I've ever been this unsettled by a story before. Superb! A lesbian couple take part in the yearly fruit harvest in a demonic local orchard. One of them is accidentally jabbed by a thorn, and suddenly the orchard doesn't seem so demonic any more...serious bio-horror ensues! The Jaws of Ouroboros (4 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐) Fine New Weird fiction! The old stone circles, which were the teeth of subterranean monsters, have awoken and are eating the landscape -- dirt, farms, animals, people and all. The by-product is a highly addictive ambergris that local drug lords want to get their hands on. Two ambergris collectors fall afoul of their buyer in a rather gristly -- and shockingly mineral -- fashion! The First Order of Whaleyville's Divine Basilisk Handlers (3 stars ⭐⭐⭐) I'm unsure if this is supposed to be a satire on horror in general, or if it's serious. In any case, this story of an attack of basilisk from a rival snake-handling church doesn't go well for any of the faithful in Whaleyville. Awkward, as it seems to want to be comic, but not really. Pumpkin Dear (4 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐) A creative mash-up of the nursery rhyme \"Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater\" and the legend of Jack 'o the Lantern. Some phenomenal images and scenes, but is slightly over-long. In need of just a light edit to hit 5 stars. The Way of the Mother (3 stars ⭐⭐⭐) Dark fantasy with a Lord of the Forest and a mysteriously invisible village in his thrall. Only at the end does it become what I'd term folk horror when the mother of a family is sacrificed to keep the village safe from the modern world. Fantasy is really not my thing, so I didn't enjoy this one so much. You might more. Leave the Night (3 stars ⭐⭐⭐) A town that time forgot and their bizarre yearly ritual out at the old glass factory. Lovecraftian in concept (reminiscent of The Shadow over Innsmouth ), but written in a too vague and poetic a style and with too slow and meandering of a plot to make a lasting impression. Revival (4 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐) a good story, but not one I'd term folk horror as it's about evangelical Christian snake handlers and the understanding and friendship the daughter of the family has with the cottonmouths they keep for their preaching. Not unsettling or even scary unless you have a snake phobia. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

Of course there's duds, like with every short story collection (and which stories end up as the duds depends entirely on the reader), but the vibes of the collection as a whole are off the charts. I love folk horror, man. The standout stories for me were \"The Jaws of Ouroboros\" ( A. nails it, it is indeed a straightforward gangster story that's transformed by the setting into something special) and \"The First Order of Whaleyville’s Divine Basilisk Handlers\" (I thought the story was violently overwritten and almost predictable when I started, but the finale surprised me and I've been thinking about the story since) The negative shoutouts go to \"Leave the Night\" (insanely boring, predictable since page 1) and \"Revival\" (sorry to be \"that\" person, but it wasn't even folk horror, it was southern gothic at best). --> No translation was found using the current translator.

Somewhat loosely organized around themes such as maintaining your primary relationship with husband, dropping the rope and letting go of unwinnable tugs-of-war with ex-wives, importance of clarity in custody agreements, etc. etc. Highly anecdotal -- authors and stepmoms they know weighing in on sometimes-gratifying, often-stressful/conflictual interactions as they navigate raising blended families. They don't say that they're White, cisgender, and of high SES [they don't need to say that they're heterosexual -- no discussion at all of LGBT couples], but that was my inference from the lack of consideration of diversity issues, plus very high prevalence of wine bars [where girlfriends go to complain about husbands' ex-wives who cause drama, I gather] and of driving kids to soccer games and of ex-wives' malevolently messing up one's carefully made exotic family vacation plans. So if you're looking for a systematic-research-driven, diversity-including overview of stepfamilies, probably not. But if you enjoy eavesdropping on a slice of society to hear what vexes [and occasionally pleases] them about their lot, this could be a book for you. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: In the myth of Theseus, the king of Crete, Minos, commands his captive invetor, Daedalus, to build a maze so intricate that nobody could escape from it without help. In this maze he places the Minotaur, a man-bull hybrid who eats people. (The minotaur is also, I think, the king's wife's son. By a bull. Yep, we're definitely in a Greek myth here). Every year, Minos demands tribute from lesser kings (Theseus's father Aegeus among them) in the form of a shipload of treasure and seven youths and seven maidens, chosen by lot, to go into the maze to be eaten by the Minotaur. One year, Theseus volunteers to take the place of one of the youths, meets Minos's daughter Ariadne, who falls in love with him and agrees to help him by giving him a ball of string he can use to thread his way through the maze. He succeeds in killing the Minotaur and escaping the maze, but his father believes he has died and kills himself even as Theseus is on his way back. Very few of these details are conserved in Victor Pelevin's hilarious, thought-provoking and ultimately baffling retelling of the story. We meet eight characters: Ariadne, and seven pseudonymous strangers who find themselves in different hotel rooms sitting at computers. They are all confused as to where they are and how they got there, and find their chat (over some kind of in-house intranet) is being filtered to prevent the exchange of concrete, real-world facts (names, places of origin, addresses, etc.) and also swear words. The form of the novel is the online dialogue between these eight characters, replying to the single message posted on the sole online forum they can access (as I mentioned, they're not on the Internet, but an intranet): I shall construct a labyrinth in which I can lose myself, together with anyone who tries to find me - who said this and about what? Ariadne, who posted the message, acts as a sort of guide through the \"labyrinth\" that seems to be both physical (the hotel) and psychological. The characters explore their literal and figurative environments in different ways: a know-it-all type named \"Monstradamus\" uses his academic knowledge to parse the hidden symbolic and etymological meanings of the few clues that are present; \"Romeo\" and \"Isolde\" jointly decide to leave their rooms and try to find each other, periodically reporting to the group what they find; \"Nutscracker\" uses his background as a computer programmer to try to understand what he comes to believe is the virtual reality they've entered; \"Sartrik\" gets drunk and disparages everyone else's suggestions; Ariadne, who seems to be a lucid dreamer, dreams about meeting a dwarf who explains the labyrinth and the Minotaur to her; and \"UGLI 666\" sees religious symbolism in everything around her, and decides that her imprisonment is a penance for her sins, which she must endure before finally meeting God. Nobody gets very far in their attempt to make sense of the maze and identify Theseus and the Minotaur. (Monstradamus, interestingly enough, is named as both). Ariadne dreams of a \"helmet of horror,\" which her diminutive guide tells her represents the Minotaur's mind: a machine that generates past, present and future from the immediate past. (The \"stream of impressions\", which come from both outside the helmet of horror and within its \"horns of plenty\", is diffracted through the \"separator labyrinth\" and changed into \"bubbles of hope,\" which are enriched by memories stored in the horns of plenty --- Monstradamus is the first to discover that this process does not actually transform anything, since the stream of impressions and the contents of the horns of plenty are all memories --- past --- so logically nothing would seem able to enter the helmet of horror at all). Much time is spent discussing and speculating on the nature of the helmet of horror, and the implication of Ariadne's dream that they are all trapped inside a virtual reality, perhaps all wearing helmets of horror that filter and shape their perceptions. I did not really understand the ending, except in the most abstract sense. What happens is that each character hears a loud knocking on their doors, and the doors are broken down and a stranger enters their rooms, his speech appearing on their screens under the name of \"Theseus.\" He believes them all to be minotaurs, and they all shout \"MOO!\" at him. (Several times near the end, the characters all speak a nonsensical phrase in unison; it seemed to me like something was taking possession of --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: I am not the typical intended audience for this book, as I'm a lifelong abstainer from alcohol and other chemicals. I've been told by a sober person that I'm an abnormal normie. But in part because of my non-drinking ways, I have a lot of friends who've been through the 12-step programs, I know the lingo and can take somebody else's inventory like nobody's business. The big things that Bucky addresses are issues that a lot of people I know have with 12-step groups - atheism, being part of a group, and worries about the effect on being an artist. Bucky offers several alternative ways to think about Higher Power, and delves into other ways to conceptualize the steps in a non-theistic way. The main one he talks about is the \"Ideal Image,\" your idea of what the best possible You would be like and be able to accomplish. Being an individualist are a big reason a lot of people find to not go to 12-step groups. Bucky goes into this in depth, but one thing that rang true to me is that isolating yourself by trying to get sober without going to a group is like being a punk but hanging out with jocks. The first group you try might not be for you, but keep looking and you'll find the right one. One of the best sections is \"The Artist and Recovery,\" where he gets really specific about his life as a writer, spoken word performer, and comedian - he busts the myths about alcohol, drugs and artists - just because your hero used a particular chemical doesn't mean that it's going to make you a great artist to use it, or a productive one. Another concept he talks about which I think anyone regardless of sobriety could find helpful is the idea of the line of control - things you can control vs. things you can't control. The thing is, that line dividing the two is not static - things you do today can expand or contract your future possibilities in life. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

I have to say that while this novel did have some key differences from others of its kind (especially towards the end), for the main part, it starts with the usual formulaic sequences. Considering that there really isn't much to change one's view of the events that are anticipated to come, I would have liked to have seen some really stand-out characters to bring the story alive in a different manner. Unfortunately, I never connected to any of them, and found their personalities to be very predictable and cliched overall. \". . .

A halfway decent Batwoman story about Kate Kane and Maggie Sawyer in the flood. Black Canary and her backstory and how she ended up working for the Feds. Lame Catwoman, is this Nocenti? No, it's John Layman! Layman redeems himself with the Jim Gordon story...dirty cops, Batman, Gordon and Bullock. Flash from the TPB...already read...Barry meets Harv Bullock and Iris West, but only falls in love with one... Jeff Lemire and a Green Arrow that seems to introduce Diggle...makes more sense to me, I thought the character was named after Andy... John Stewart as a Marine vs. Anarky in a Katrina-sequel, with shades of civil rights? Hmm... Dick Grayson ends up saving Sal Maroni's kid, and therefore Haly is introduced to Maroni....oops! Oh and we get first appearance of Amygdala! Who? Yup. The best is saved for last, in my opinion...Jason Todd dons a Red Hood, runs into the Red Hood gang, the original Red Hood, now a man wrapped in bandages and laughing maniacally...hmmm...who could that be? Well if you want even more chills? There's also a scene with Jason and this fellow in a basement, and the fellow is standing above Jason with...yes, a crowbar... The final panel of this character shows undoubtedly, this is the Joker! I found him pretty terrifying. Which means, it worked.

There’s a certain thrill associated with exposing yourself to such movies - will I be able to separate myself from the horror or will I not sleep tonight?! Behind the Horror is a book that will appeal to horror movie fans, as well as true crime fanatics and those who enjoy the paranormal - and if you happen to love all of those, like myself, then it will feel like the holy grail. In each chapter, Dr Lee Mellor tackles a different horror movie that is inspired by a real life story. First and foremost, there are spoilers for the horror movies that Mellor is discussing, so you’ve been warned! Luckily I had already seen most of the movies covered, and those that I haven’t seen I didn’t care too much about reading the plot. Each chapter opens with a short summary of the movie in question, before Mellor delves into the surrounding background. Numerous famous movies and cases are explored, from The Exorcist, Jaws and The Conjuring to the crimes of Ted Bundy, the exorcism of “Roland Doe” and the Salem witch trials. And shout out to my faves Ed and Lorraine Warren who made a few appearances! But there were also a few less popular ones that I had never heard of before, such as the Texarkana moonlight murders and the Gainesville Ripper. All very interesting. I enjoyed revisiting the stories and movies that I know so well, in addition to learning some new facts and trivia that I can slide up my sleeve for future reference. I’d definitely recommend!

I’ve seen enough horror/sci-fi to know that this can’t end well. However, Ethan keeps watching. He can’t bring himself to stop. He is freaked out, but finds himself contemplating his life and all the choices that lead him to his current existence. I really enjoyed this book. Very cool concept. Narration was great!

            "⚠ Translation error: Lullabies for Suffering is the second addiction themed anthology edited by Mark Mathews. The six stories within these pages tell of the life-destroying effects of addictions of all varieties. These stories are personal. They are brutal and hard to read. If you have ever been touched by addiction, either your own or that of a loved one, you will find something here that resonates deeply with you. These authors give a blunt and honest peek into the mind of those battling with addiction. The lies, the justifications, the slippery slopes and the compromises they lead to. They paint a picture of addiction and all its ugly truths, including the physical and psychological effects that it has on the innocent people who get caught in the crossfire. Every single story here is an absolutely powerful take on this dark topic. My Favorite Story Monsters- Caroline Kepnes: This story is told mostly through the rambling internal monologue of Vince, a young college student whose mother is a cocaine addict in and out of rehab. Kepnes excellently illustrates the debilitating self doubt that can come from being raised by an addict. Vince’s internal thoughts are fraught with self-loathing, sexual frustration, and doubt. It’s clear he cares so much about his mother, but her habit and behaviours continually crush him. The other segments of the story are told in third person, centered around Ariel, the twelve year old girl down the street from Vince. When Vince babysits Ariel, some of her own personal demons come out. The Rest of Them, in Order of Appearance Sometimes They See Me- Kealan Patrick Burke: This story begins with two strangers meeting on a bridge one night, and instantly connecting. They both went there to commit suicide, but instead, found comfort in each other. As they spend time together, they talk about their pasts and what has led them to this point in their lives. Things take a dark and bizarre turn as we discover the true nature of the two characters. Burke crafts a strange and intimate tale with an extremely unexpected ending. Lizard- Mark Matthews: Lizabeth “Lizard” Baker is a parole officer who specializes in mothers with drug charges. After receiving another in a long line of rejections from adoption agencies, Lizabeth heads off to her first home visit in her new position. Matthews flips between the present and Lizard’s childhood, slowly shedding light on her parent’s addictions and the terrible things it led to. All of Lizard’s inner demons come to a head in the shocking and surreal climax of the story. The Melting Point of Meat -John FD Taff: It was very tough to pick a favorite of these stories, and The Melting Point of Meat was an incredibly close second.This story introduces us to Livy, a young girl who’s addiction is pain. Told in alternating first and third person, Taff walks us through Livy’s life as she discovers her love for pain and her growing need for more of it. When she learns of a secret scientific study being conducted on pain, she knows that she has to find a way in. I love the delivery method Taff uses here. The passages through Livy’s eyes show her thoughts on her own addiction, and on how addiction progresses and transforms a person. With a terrifying cosmic theme and a dynamite ending, The Melting Point of Meat is an absolutely thrilling read. I’ll definitely be looking into more of John FD Taff’s work. Beyond The Reef- Gabino Iglesias: Locked in a hotel room, our protagonist Adam frantically records the story of how he got here for his daughter Angelica. He hopes to explain why he did the things he did, and what led him to this point in his life. With ominous overtones of some mysterious impending doom, Adam relays the tale of how he became hooked on heroin, and the series of poor choices and chance happenstances that led down a slippery slope and into a pool of danger. Iglesias does a wonderful job of showing just how fast things can snowball, and how easily addiction can get on top of you and have you doing things you never thought you would. Love is a Crematorium- Mercedes M. Yardley: Kelly and Joy are two young kids in love. Joy’s father viciously abuses her, and when she has finally had enough, the two lovers run away to the big city. Their plans quickly turn to ash as they struggle and starve, homeless and penniless. As their situation becomes more and more dire, compromises have to be made. This is truly a story of just how quickly things can completely fall apart, and how one compromise o --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: EXCERPT: The sounds of the party lulled her to sleep until she awoke to the darkness. The light was off. The bed was warm. Anna Beth was talking in whispers; maybe trying not to wake her. 'What are you doing here? Get out . . .' Who was she talking to? 'Who's there?' Erin asked. 'Don't hurt -' Then that flash of pain - that agonizing flash of pain - before all the darkness. The never-ending darkness . . . of oblivion and ignorance . . . ABOUT 'AFRAID': LUCY Lucy Champagne was sent to St. Cecilia’s after her movie-star mother was brutally attacked by her sleazy boyfriend, Ray Watkins. Lucy’s damning testimony landed Ray a twenty-five-year sentence. But now, Ray is free. And he’s going to find Lucy and make her pay, no matter how far and how fast she runs . . . RAYNE Rayne Taylor found unexpected happiness at St. Cecilia’s, until her roommate, Natalie, committed suicide. Only when Rayne finds a box of mementoes from that time does she realize how wrong she may have been about Natalie’s death—and how far someone will go to keep the truth hidden . . . ERIN Erin MacDonald remembers little about the long-ago night she and her sister, Anna Beth, were kidnapped. While Erin was found safe, Anna Beth vanished forever. Now Erin has reluctantly come back to the family estate, where Detective Rafe Montego hopes to finally crack the case. But as flashes of Erin’s memory reemerge, she learns how deep the danger goes . . . MY THOUGHTS: There are three stories in Afraid, each written by a different author: Retribution by Lisa Jackson; Ghosts by Alexandra Ivy; and Alone by Lisa Childs. The stories are connected by the main characters having been friends at boarding school, St. Cecilia's in Strasbourg, Austria. Although Lucy, Rayne and Erin barely keep in touch, all three have some significant trauma in their pasts, which occurred either at St Cecilia's or was the reason they were sent there. These are novellas so not quite as fleshed out as a full novel would be, yet I enjoyed each of the three very different stories equally. The characters, particularly Lucy, are not always likeable but, especially in Lucy's case, I could understand why she was the way she was. Her guilt would be a terrible thing to live with. And if she can't like or trust herself, then who can she like and trust? All three stories have varying elements of romance in them, but not enough to qualify them as romantic suspense. All three stories centre on individual tragedies, but the themes of loss, guilt, family dynamics and the quest for justice run through all three stories.

And I have most certainly enjoyed this story too! It was a good exciting story about a lady FBI agent working a case about a serial killer who leaves bodies up in trees. Now sometimes I enjoy this kind of story and sometimes I don't. It all depends on the writing style. Mainly I like getting into the main character's head so I can understand them. And that certainly happens in here with Ella. I quickly knew all sorts of stuff about her. And even though I have not read the first book at all I was quickly able to grasp the situation here. The story moves fast and there are many twists and turns but I think what I like best is the fact Ella is very human. She makes mistakes. She feels stuff, including embarrassment if she jumps to conclusions. But she also listens to her gut too. Because sometimes she just knows. And she is willing to put her life on the line too... And there is certainly mystery in here too. Because who is the killer? I did not try to guess. I just enjoyed reading this...

            "⚠ Translation error: I won this book via Goodreads' Firstreads. This book is a collection of essays about the Black Panther movie from African American and black authors. When I went to see Black Panther, I knew it was a big deal and historic. I got emotional when the movie started because I had an inkling of what it meant to the community it was representing in a positive light. (I even cried during the opening credits because of the overwhelming feeling of history and import I got, I really can't imagine what it was like for African Americans. I also cried at the sad bits and watching the second movie.) This book gave me some idea of the import of this movie to the African American and black communities about the world, though I'm sure I can't fully understand it. The insights into the meaning of the costumes by the actual costume designer and all the other perspectives were amazing. Many of the authors talked about how Black Panther allowed people to access more than one dimension of the black story, and a way into the multi-faceted culture and history of black people.

How powerful the portrayal of Black and African community is to the world and even more specific to the US. Representation is important and empowered representation even more so.

This was a great collection of short stories - some only 2-3 pages long, while others averaged around 20 pages; some of them more humorous than scary, and others were downright gross and freaky; but one thing is for sure, every last one was worth reading! There's everything from a desperate family in a fallout shelter after WWIII, to a man stranded on an alien landscape doing what it takes to survive as he slowly goes mad, and a little of everything in between. The best part of this read was the fact that no matter if you have 5 minutes to kill or a couple of hours there is a story the perfect length for any situation.

The author can't keep away from her northern roots and use of locations by sending the detective Sophie Evans to the North East in her investigations.

She went to San Francisco to do it, but this being the 1960s, she got tangled up in all that free love and getting high and went off the rails. So she went back to Texas, got clean and went on to study to become a teacher. And that might have been the end of that story, the girl might have gone on to live a long and decent life and the world would have never heard of Janis Joplin. But, of course, that isn’t how it went down. Once back in Texas, Janis quickly realized that normal life wasn’t her thing and went back to performing. And all the partying that went on with it. Prior to reading this book I was thinking…boy, she died so young, but having read it, it’s amazing she lasted that long. Janis didn’t just burn her candle at both ends, she threw them into bonfires and active volcanoes. She drank and got high and went through lovers with a kind of almost impressive albeit terrifying regularity. It was like she hit the world hungry and nothing would sate it. It sounded exhausting. It sounded sad. And eventually, it sounded like silence because she ODed. But then again silence isn’t ever going to associated with Janis Joplin, because however brief her stay on this planet was, the music she left behind goes on and on and on. This is a pretty stereotypical biography of a music star, it follows a familiar trajectory of tragedy and 60s and 70s really were a killer of talent. All that indulgence…too much of too much. Terrible attitudes, terrible clothes, but boy, did they make some good music. A pretty good book created by one of Joplin’s former associates with a nice personal approach to it. Nice art.

            "⚠ Translation error: Love Me Please: The Story of Janis Joplin is the first graphic novel/biography I've read. I wasn't certain what to expect, particularly after just reading a disappointing children's book about other legendary musicians, but Love Me Please not only looked at her immense talent, rise to fame, her difficult upbringing, and her troubles with self-esteem, relationships, and addiction, but also the concern of those around her. The narrator of the book speaks to both Janice and to the audience in a tone that expresses her compassion and regret for Janice - her sorrows, her struggles, and her loss. In 154 pages we're taken back to a major historical time in popular music. The illustrations capture the colors, shapes, vibe, and aesthetic of the 1960s and early 70s. The story touches on the important emotional experiences for Janice, the significant events in music, and the people who shared experiences with Janice. Love Me Please is a realistic, 360 perspective of Janice, the people, and events of that legendary time in music. Though the graphic novel/biography is a revelation of Janice Joplin's short career and life, its respect for the other figures of the time is impressive, particularly in the Character Gallery at the back of the book. The Gallery is an index of the famous and infamous individuals who influenced Janice and provided the color of her life. It also provides reference sources for readers to further expand their understanding of Janice and the time in music. In offering this additional information, Love Me Please, gives everyone an opportunity to see the community that made up the universe around Janice and, therefore, the other musicians of the time. Love Me Please allows you to put yourself into the story of Janice and see how Janice may be part of your story too. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: Bez cienia wątpliwości Janis Joplin to prawdziwa muzyczna legenda, która mogła pokazać światu znacznie większą dawkę swojego niezwykłego talentu. Jej krótkie, ale mocno burzliwe życie stało się podstawą wielu różnorakich biografii. Jedną z nich jest album Love me please, w którym twórcy starają się przybliżyć czytelnikowi losy tej urodzonej buntowniczki, która lubiła łamać zasady i panujące wokół niej konwenanse. Początek albumu to dość szybki i skrótowy przegląd wczesnego dzieciństwa JJ, która przyszła na świat 19 stycznia 1943 roku w Port Arthur (Teksas). Już w czesnym okresie swojego życia przejawiała ona niemałe zdolności muzyczne. Głos i talent odziedziczyła ona po matce, która w późniejszych latach nie wspierała jednak córki w jej „rozwoju muzycznym”. Typowo biograficzne dane autor przeplata informacjami o traumach dzieciństwa, które miały pewien wymierny wpływ na całą jej przyszłość. Dość dosadnie pokazuje on również to, że Janis od małego miała mocno buntowniczą naturę, która nie mogła pogodzić się z ograniczeniami narzucanymi przez społeczeństwo tamtego okresu. Finet na kolejnych stronach płynnie przechodzi przez kolejne etapy życia gwiazdy. Pokazane są tutaj początki jej kariery, różnorodne towarzystwo, w jakim się obracała, muzyczne wzloty i upadki oraz wszelkiego rodzaju nałogi. Autor nie ukrywa, że Jenis lubiła eksperymentować. Zarówno z alkoholem, wszelkiego rodzaju narkotykami, jak i sexem. Obserwujemy więc postępujący obraz jej zanurzania się w oparach autodestrukcji. Wszystko to było jej desperacką próbą odnalezienia właściwego kierunku życia. W kilku fragmentach albumu można jednak odnieść wrażenie, że twórca niepotrzebnie stara się „tłumaczyć” artystkę. Potrzeba miłości i brak zrozumienia otoczenia nie jest wytłumaczeniem postępującego uzależnienia (jest to jednak moja subiektywna ocena). Na całe szczęście autor nie spycha tego elementu biografii Joplin na daleki plan. Stara się on dość dokładnie pokazać destrukcyjność jej życia, które zakończyło się zdecydowanie przedwcześnie. Jeżeli zaś chodzi o duże zalety albumu, to na pewno należy do nich zaliczyć szereg interesujących treści związanych z muzyczną karierą Joplin. Wielu miłośników jej twórczości niekoniecznie musi sobie zdawać sprawę z muzycznych zamiłowań artystki. Janis była fanką wielu afroamerykańskich śpiewaków bluesowych i to oni byli mocną inspiracją wielu jej utworów. Całkiem dobrze prezentuje się tutaj również oprawa graficzna. Rysunki są dosyć proste, ale potrafią one przykuwać wzrok czytelnika. Na swój sposób ewoluują one wraz z kolejnymi przewróconymi stronami komiksu i dość interesująco obrazują kolejne etapy życia bohaterki. Szczególnie ciekawie prezentuje się tutaj obraz nadużywania przez Joplin środków odurzających. Artysta z jednej strony potrafi być w takich scenach dość dosadny i dokładny, w innych zaś wykorzystuje alegoryczne obrazy do ukazania postępującej destrukcji życia. https://popkulturowykociolek.pl/recen... --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: This was a very fast-paced story that suited Janis Joplin’s very fast-paced life. Her life was heartbreakingly too short. The story and art didn’t shy away from showing her drug and alcohol consumption, which is obviously a huge part of her story. I think it’s important to see all the external pressures put on her (and others, too). She was constantly swarmed with drug dealers, record labels wouldn’t sign her because of her addiction, but also help was really hard to come by. The story also included her many musical influences, which I thought was really rad. Overall, the art style was my favorite because I felt like I was living in the 60’s right along side her. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: Karen Rose ist eine sehr beliebte Autorin im Thrillergenre, die bekannt dafür ist, gekonnt Romance und Thrillerelemente miteinander zu kombinieren. Auch mir hat die Geschichte rund um Kristen, Abe und den Rächer gut gefallen. Ihr Schreibstil liest sich wunderbar flüssig und unterstützt durch die kurzen knackigen Kapitel bin ich förmlich durch die 600 Seiten geflogen. Besonders gut haben mir die Charaktere gefallen. Kristen ist eine starke Staatsanwältin, die für ihre Klienten einsteht und alles in ihrer Macht stehende für die Gerechtigkeit tut. Dabei ist sie knallhart, aber auch unglaublich sympathisch. Der Anfang war sehr stark, aber je länger die Geschichte voranschritt, umso mehr rückte der Fokus von Kristens Arbeit weg und verlagerte sich ausschließlich auf die Machtspiele der Mafia und die Morde. Ich hätte gerne durchgängig mehr von Kristens Alltag mitbekommen, denn es ist durchaus viel passiert, aber auch sehr viel, was gar nicht mit dem Fall zu tun hatte. In diesem Moment sind wir bei Abe Reagan angekommen, der nicht nur den Fall bearbeitet, sondern ebenfalls den Love Interest in der Geschichte darstellt. Ich hätte mir niemals zu träumen gewagt, dass ich das mal sagen werde, aber mir war der Romanceanteil eindeutig zu groß. Ich mag Kristen und Abe und Abes herzensgute Familie, die der Geschichte stellenweise eine Wohlfühlatmosphäre verliehen hat, aber leider plätschert der Fall die Hälfte der Zeit vor sich hin, was ich sehr schade finde, weil ich die Auflösung des Falls eigentlich sehr gelungen finde. Den Epilog möchte ich am liebsten unter den Teppich fallen lassen. Dieser ist an übermäßigem Kitsch und \"Würg Momenten\" nicht zu überbieten. Ich finde es unglaublich schade, dass so ein guter Thriller mit einem 0815 Liebesromanende abgeschlossen werden muss! Für mich ging der Schuss eher nach hinten los. Insgesamt sympathische Charaktere, ein interessanter Fall, der sich ab der Hälfte leider im Kreis dreht und ein Epilog, der jedem 0815 \"Frauenroman\" alle Ehre machen würde.

This comic has more in relation to Fletcher Hanks comics than any modern superhero comic. It's a pretty simple story of Wonder Woman going up against an evil super villain. She ends up brainwashed and forced to battle Supergirl. Marvel Girl joins the battle at some point and helps cure Wonder Woman. It's goofy and fun. With flat, simple, but effective artwork by Hernandez. I'd love to see him take on more Marvel/DC characters with this approach. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: So a bit of a mixed bag, though overall the stories are good and so is the artwork. The book starts with \"Gothamazon\" by Simone where Wonder Woman steps in to help Gotham while the Bats clan, with the exceptation of Oracle, are down for the count. The story illustrates, quite well, the differences between Batman and Wonder Woman. There are also some nice touches of humor. The second story \"Defender of Truth\" by Amanda Diebert and the fifth, \"Bullets and Bracelets\" by Sean Williams are, perhaps, a bit too heavy on the moral of the story, but who cares? They are enjoyable stories. The two stories \"Brace Yourself\" and \"Taketh Away\" touch on some of the same issues - though \"Brace Yourself\" as far more humor; Jason Bischoff's stories of Diana vs Mom were great. Cohen's \"Taketh\" actually highlights the expecetions that women are forced to handle on a daily basis, including treatment when they decline an invitation as well as the expectation to be beautiful all the time. The most problematic story is \"No Chains Can Hold Her\" and while it references the early days of comics and seems tongue in cheek, it falls completely flat. As does \"Ghosts and Gods\". For whatever reason the story doesn't quite work. \"The Attack of the 50 Foot Wonder Woman\" and \"Dig for Fire\" are pretty good adventure stories, though one is light in tone than the other. My favorite is \"Morning Coffee\" by Ollie Masters which involves Wonder Woman hunting down Catwoman. It's just wonderful. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: 4 Stars! A High-Octane filled Romantic Suspense! When Daisy Dawson is assaulted by a bald man with a stocking over his face she fights back and gets away. She is the first woman ever to do so. Before getting away she grabbed a locket off of his neck. Turns out it’s significant as the locket is linked to past crimes. FBI agent Gideon Reynolds recognizes it. It has a name engraved on the back: Miriam. He knows who it belongs to, someone he used to know. His sister Mercy wore one just like it. The fact that it has surfaced gives him both hope and it scares him to death. Now Agent Reynolds is assigned to the protection detail of Daisy Dawson and is desperate to figure out how these cases are connected before something worse happens. The clock however is ticking and whoever is out to get Daisy has grand plans. “Say You’re Sorry” is a wicked fast-paced, easy to read, romantic suspense that kept me highly entertained. Though it’s over 600 pages, I flew through it in what seemed like just a few hours. This was my first Karen Rose novel - it came highly recommended and I must say, I am so glad I took a chance on this fabulous read! This was another buddy read with Kaceey! Thank you to Elisha at Berkley Publishing Group and to Karen Rose for a galley of this novel in exchange for an honest review. Published to Goodreads, Twitter on 12.5.18.

            "⚠ Translation error: Steamy, heart-pounding, and engrossing—Karen Rose’s latest novel of romantic suspense has a little something for everyone! I find romantic suspense to be an incredibly difficult genre to write. For me, romantic suspense novels tend to tip too heavily towards the romance, and leave the suspense part feeling rushed. Say You’re Sorry doesn’t feel that way at all! With the skill to handle the delicate balance between two strong genres, I can see why Karen Rose is so beloved! Reflection I want to dedicate my entire review to Daisy Dawson. What an incredible character! Daisy is super strong while having the sensitivity of a more fragile woman. And not in the annoying way many romance heroines are! Reading Say You’re Sorry, I truly felt that Daisy could have survived the book without Gideon. Daisy is a fighter and she kills them with kindness and a deadly sharp shot! Daisy gives the impression that she could survive anything! She is fierce about her convictions, but she still shakes after conflict. Daisy know what she wants and she knows what she is worth. And she gives as much love to the world as she can! But of course, it wouldn’t be romantic suspense without a little bit of heat—or a lot of it! And Karen Rose delivers with hot and brooding Gideon. With a dark, abusive past, Gideon is an atypical hero for our recovering addict, fierce femme—but he is impossible to write off once you get to know him! Gideon is not just a hottie, he has a heart of gold and treats Daisy with respect! Basically, the perfect man. The mystery itself is so compelling! About 50% of the book is narrated by the creepy serial killer who is the main antagonist of the book. This mysterious figure is so messed up! If he didn’t do such horrific things, there are moments where I almost pitied him and his past. But then I remember what he has done and I want him to burn!!! There’s also a fascinating cult storyline—one that inadvertently is the catalyst for not only the killer’s downfall, but also for Daisy and Gideon’s fated union. Hold on for a crazy compelling story with this cult! I could read a whole book about it and it’s twisted, damaging philosophy pretending to protect those it victimizes the most!

Thriller A Thon: Thriller with the best cover 50 States Thriller Challenge: California As you should all know by now, I like to keep my expectations low. If you keep expectations low, than you're more likely to have an enjoyable experience. Say You're Sorry is the first Karen Rose novel I've read and until I won this book I hadn't even looked at any of her other books. So I based my expectations off of the fact that her series were described as Romance Suspense. I was expecting something more along the lines of Nora Roberts. That's not shade I read Nora Roberts and respect them for what they are. That said I don't expect hard hitting crime when I read Nora Roberts. So imagine my surprise when I open this book and I am hitting with some pretty detailed torture scenes. Me likey!!! Say You're Sorry not only provided me with a great serial killer hunt but we get the added bonus(Im pretty sure thats an oxymoron) of smut! The sex scenes in this book are HOT! y'all.

This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review. 4.5 hearts I started reading immediately after finishing Death is Not Enough , the previous book in this Romantic Suspense series .  It worked out well as the main character, Daisy is introduced there. I thought I would not like a new city Sacramento. How silly of me not to trust Karen Rose. Daisy was not my favorite character until I really saw her in Say You're Sorry .  She's amazing, so smart and careful and trained.  Her restricted childhood is something she shares with an FBI agent, Gideon.  He has made efforts to settle things from his past, but until Daisy comes along and looks outside the regular procedural box, he doesn't make as much progress. Oddly, they fit well together. Gideon is also smart enough to trust her skills and not just blindly default to  protect her she's a woman attitude. He still feels it I think but he acknowledges her abilities. This is pretty fast paced and in a few spots I am sure they will die from the serial killer.  I felt a little sorry for the criminal, as he has had little for himself ever.  But really, Gideon didn't have anything either and he doesn't go torture and kill women. Every book is great; I highly recommend them. I would start in order or at least within a city. Each book is a new couple, but there are connections between all the books as they all work in some aspect of law enforcement. I love the connections and circle of friends who support each other, and seeing them briefly in future books to get updates on their lives. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: this, but it did nothing for me. I have several works from Kiste, so I’ll see if it was just the subject matter or the author. 3/5 Mightier Than Bullets by Laurel Hightower: Excellent short story which ended on a pitch perfect note! A story about a school shooting. 5/5 Loud and Clear by Max Booth III: Liked the idea behind this one and Lynne was a particularly colourful character. It came across as a dark comedy in places but the story started to fall apart near the end, in my opinion. 4/5 Better by You, Better than Me by Rebecca Rowland: Clever title using the Judas Priest/Spooky Tooth song which was used as part of the pushback against heavy metal in the 80s. The inference was that Judas Priest used subliminal messaging to incite teenagers to kill themselves. Similar themes and plot used in this short story. Although well-written, it just fell flat for me. 3/5 A Nightmare on Elm Lane by Richard Chizmar: A nice play on a NightMare on Elm street. For some reason this short story reminded of “Big Surprise”by Richard Matheson mixed with any Scooby Doo episode that featured Old Man Jenkins. Very enjoyable read with a perfect ending. 5/5 The Visitor by Philip Fracassi: Excellent title for the story. I have several titles written by Fracassi on my reading list and I have no idea why it has taken me so long to get to them because every single time I read one of his short stories, I am blown away at how good he is. This is a must read short story that leaks dread and terror. 5/5 Lips like a Scythe by Steve Van Samson: This was quite the badass story with a B-movie monster of the week vibe, and over-the -top characters (aka Heather Finch) that have a sense of comedic timing. Very fun read! 4.5/5 White Pages by Clay McLeod Chapman: Clever little story! Reminded me of all of the prank calling we did in the 1980s. Chapmans comment that you can be basically be anyone until the day your name is added to the White Pages was very astute. 4/5 --> No translation was found using the current translator.

Jean Paul has really grown on me as a character and his relationship with Luke is awesome! I can't believe Luke made him a suit without telling Jean Paul about it! I really love how supporting they are of each other. I also enjoyed Zatanna in this one! She's a character I haven't read much of but I always love when she shows up. She was even more powerful than I expected and this volume surprised me quite a bit. It was interesting that Batman truly took a backseat for this volume. Unfortunately Clay Face and Cass are pretty much just here to fight and that's about it. Presumably because Cass' arc took place last volume and they still haven't gone that far into an arc with Clay Face. I'm sure that's coming. All in all, A+ here. This is the one series I'll keep reading as we go further into this year because Super Sons and Batwoman were cancelled and those were the only DC books I had on my pull list.

I do enjoy the evolving friendship between Clayface and Orphan though. The penultimate issue ends with a couple of revelations that tie into the ongoing arc. My favourite issue, however, was the standalone Spoiler issue at the end of the volume.

            "⚠ Translation error: This book features a five-part arc and a solo story featuring Stephanie Brown. The five-part arc has two elements. First is a story focusing on Jean-Paul Valley (Azrael), the cultic order of Saint Dumas is back to mess with him and perhaps introduce an AI version of Azrael who is not subject to doubts. The B plot of the story involves Bruce Wayne and Zatara reminiscing over old times while Bruce seeks access to all-knowing relic. The B plot is the better plot by far. Zatara and her magical world are beautifully drawn and we get some insight into Bruce's character and past. It's nice to see. The Jean-Paul Valley plot is far less enjoyable. It's hard to get into him as a character. The story attempts profundity but mostly offers up cliches on issues of faith and philosophy. It's not horrible. There's some action that's not bad to look at, but this part didn't impress me. The one part story with Stephanie Brown is mixed for me. It's nice to see her in a solo adventure, and she does a good job taking on the criminal. But, I find her lack of self-awareness annoying. Vigilante Superheroes are problematic. She is not a superhero. She is dressing up in a costume to fight crime and is not an authorized agent of the law, but she is not a vigilante superhero. Nope. Nope. I get that her reaction is partially due to the apparent loss of Tim Drake in Vol. 1 but that doesn't make her much less annoying. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

I like her drive, not her wonky motivation. I like her skill but she's also not green enough to be Spoiler. Yeah I like this character a lot from the DCU of the past so I feel kinda off about this New52 version. Jean Paul is whatever, was never a big fan of him as Azbats before so this new take is better. The Mark Spektor thing is pollination from Marvel and I'm kinda okay with it cause this is suppose to be about Jean fighting his beliefs and a physical manifestation was kinda fun. And yes Rookie is Tony Starks robot in the films. It was enjoyable, good not great but I do like the character focus. Wish it was deeper and less actiony.

The primary plot of catching the serial killer and solving decades old mysteries was an interesting part of the story, but it was often disrupted by repetitive information and unnecessary drama. Romance? Meh. Deacon’s first appearance stood out, but his character quickly bored me. Faith was too perfect to be true. The explicit sex scenes were more like cheesy fillers in the story. A proliferation of characters, contrived subplots and inconsequential details made this book an exhausting read for me:/ --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: Getting Even by Lisa Jackson combines two of her earlier romantic suspense novels into this newly released book. The novels have common themes of revenge, suspense, romance, and some action as well. Yesterday’s Lies is set in Sinclair, Oregon and features Tory Wilson and Trask McFadden. Tory and Trask were in love, but five years ago Trask tore Tory’s world apart when his testimony landed her father in prison for horse swindling using information Tory had told him in confidence. On top of that, her father died in prison. Now Trask is asking for her help. Tory is determined, prideful, feels guilty, and is working hard to get the family ranch profitable. Trask has become a U.S. senator, regrets his actions hurt Tory, but did what he felt he had to do. Both characters go through attitude and outlook changes as the story progresses. The plot is relatively straightforward with a few twists here and there. While it was a little predictable, there’s also danger, heartache, and action with enough suspense to keep me engaged. The world-building was well-done allowing readers to be transported to the ranch. Overall, the book was engrossing and fast-paced, featuring a second chance romance with plenty of danger along the way. Themes include greed, family, trust, misplaced trust, guilt, romance, destroyed dreams, fear, and much more. Zachary’s Law features Lauren Regis and Zachary Winters and is set mainly in Portland, Oregon. Lauren’s ex-husband kidnapped her two children slightly over a year ago. Since then, the police, a private detective, and two lawyers have been unable to help her find them. One of the attorneys and a co-worker recommended she contact Zachary. He’s an unconventional attorney with a darker reputation. Lauren is desperate and asks him to help her. Lauren is tormented by the loss of her children and desperate to find them. Zachary is still suffering from the death of his wife and his business partner. They change and grow slightly as the story unfolds. The storyline was heart-wrenching at times. There was a lot more than the investigation going on in this novel. It was heavier on the romance and Lauren’s work than I expected. I felt the ending was resolved a little too easily. However, Lauren’s situation grabbed my attention and the story kept my interest. Themes include kidnapping, desperation, love, alcoholism, attraction, conflicts of interest, and trust. Overall, this was an intense story with likeable characters that kept me turning the pages. Those who enjoy romantic suspense books may want to check out this novel. Kensington Books – Zebra and Lisa Jackson provided a digital ARC of this novel via NetGalley. This is my honest review. All thoughts and opinions expressed in this review are my own. Publication date is currently expected to be February 21, 2023. This review was originally posted at Mystery and Suspense Magazine. --------------------------------------------- My 3.95 rounded to 4 stars review is coming soon. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: Getting Even: Two Thrilling Novels of Suspense by Lisa Jackson is a recommended collection (if you enjoy romance novels) of two previously published romantic suspense stories from 1986. Yesterday’s Lies and Zachary’s Law are both romantic suspense novels that share revenge as a plot element. I enjoy suspense but don't read romance novels. I have enjoyed several of Jackson's more recent suspense novels, so to be honest, the romance aspect, a central theme, bores me. However, if you enjoy novels focused more on romance with light suspense in the plot, this collection of two novels might be more up your alley. I read them because I have very much enjoyed more recent novels by Lisa Jackson. These two earlier novels most definitely showcase Jackson's growth as a novelist. In Yesterday’s Lies Tory learns that Trask is back in town and wants to see her. Trask used her five years earlier to put her now deceased father behind bars and she is not interested in anything he has to say. Trask talks to her anyway and wants Tory to help him further investigate the incident that landed her father in prison because he has learned that they may have been others involved. Zachary’s Law features Zachary Winters, an unconventional attorney with a dark reputation who locates people. Lauren Regis hires him to find her ex-husband who has kidnapped her two children as he won't share custody.

            "⚠ Translation error: Lauren's whole world collapsed the day that her ex husband Doug disappeared with their two children. She can't ever stop looking for them but everyone that she has hired hasn't made any progress. So when she is giving Zachary's name she is hopeful. But Zachary can't promise that he will be able to find them. But something about Lauren & her situation make him change his mind. Will he really be able to find them or will he also give her false hope. As their relationship starts get more serious they are given some information that could help them to find the children. Is this just another false lead or will it actually be what Lauren has been hoping for? Do they get their happy everafter? Great characters, good storyline and an enjoyable read. What I liked about Lauren is that she never gave up no matter how many times she was given bad news she just picked herself up and carried on. Zachary is a genuine guy that falls in !I've and after what he went through he was still willing to open himself up again. They make a good couple.

            "⚠ Translation error: Note to myself: nie czytaj biografii autorów z młodości, na których książek podstawie kreowałaś swój czytelniczy wszechświat. Dowiedziałam się z tego komiksu, że z Dicka był prawdziwy dick. Nieogarnięty, żyjący w swoim świecie, wiecznie szukający młodszych żon typ, który nie brał odpowiedzialności za kolejne rodziny i dzieci, za to nie stronił od przemocy. Zakompleksiony, zaszufladkowany jako autor SF, pomimo nagród i sukcesów marzący o byciu uznawanym za pisarza mainstreamowego. Żarł amfę i leki jak tik taki, przez co był niezwykle twórczy i pracował w szaleńczym tempie, ale wpędził się tym w chorobę psychiczną, ostrą paranoję i manię prześladowczą, a do tego wciągał w swoje jazdy bliskich. Owszem, miał w życiu trudne momenty - w niemowlęctwie zmarła jego siostra bliźniaczka, on sam ledwo przeżył i miał przez to problemy ze zdrowiem, których narkotyki nie wspierały. Na koniec odkleił się tak dalece, że w zasadzie uznał się za boski byt, który poznał tajemnice wszechświata. Najgorsze było dla mnie to, że wizje z jego książek, które były kiedyś dla mnie porażające i wspaniałe, okazują się być dziełem nie kreatywnego, wybitnego umysłu, tylko chorych ćpuńskich jazd. Odpycha mnie to okropnie. Nawet przez sekundę nie było mi go żal i chyba już nie wrócę do książek, których niemało mam na półce. Najzabawniejsze było dla mnie posłowie, w którym autor po tych wszystkich scenach twierdzi, że tym komiksem wyraża swoje uwielbienie, że czuł sympatię do przedstawionej postaci, że Dick może i był trudny, ale dobry i empatyczny. To chyba coś mu w przekazie nie pykło 😬 Ale sam komiks jest bardzo wartką, ciekawą opowieścią, która wydaje się uwzględniać nie tylko najważniejsze wydarzenia z życia pisarza, ale też sporo niuansów. Czyta￼ się dobrze, a ilustracje świetnie oddają ducha epoki, klimat twórczości Dicka i popadanie bohatera w coraz większy obłęd. Mam tylko uwagę do polskiego wydania - dwie strony, na których jest sporo tekstu na tyle skomplikowanego, że bez przynajmniej średniej znajomości języka angielskiego odbiorca go nie zrozumie, pozostało nieprzetłumaczone. Nie wiem czy to celowo, czy błąd redaktora. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

I knew who it was the entire time, but that didn't change the thriller aspect of it very much for me. The faith content in this book is superb. The characters are constantly going to God in times of trouble, building their faith and being challenged to walk closer with Him.

            "⚠ Translation error: Crítica original em Rascunhos Premiado ou nomeado para quase todos os prémios que possam ser atribuídos à ficção especulativa, Philip K. Dick ficou conhecido na história da ficção científica por obras que viriam a gerar os filmes Minority Report e Blade Runner. Mas ainda que a sua carreira seja de sucesso junto dos leitores, o seu precurso profissional enquanto escritor não foi muito simples. Este livro apresenta uma biografia em versão de banda desenhada, que passa por todos os momentos fundamentais do autor, interligando episódios pessoais com a concretização de obras – os vários casamentos e a quebra dos relacionamentos amorosos, o uso de drogas e a crescente psicose que o torna instável, quer a nível emocional, quer a nível profissional. Desde cedo que Philip K. Dick demonstrou uma tendência para se afastar dos padrões académicos, escolhendo escrever ficção científica ao invés de enveredar por um percurso mais tradicional. O arranque da carreira da escrita foi lento, claro. Começou por ir vendendo pequenas histórias nas revistas da época, como The Magazine of Fantasy or Science Fiction ou Planet Stories e cedo começou a participar em encontros de ficção científica, onde conheceu outros grandes escritores do género. Entre os encontros de ficção científica (onde criava ligações a outros escritores) e os romances falhados, a escrita vai sofrendo uma forte influência da peculiar visão da realidade, à qual se misturam as psicoses e as drogas. Estes dois elementos reflectem-se quer nas realidades criadas, quer em episódios mais psicadélicos que encontramos nas histórias. Ainda que o visual seja um pouco estático (e algo aborrecido), a banda desenhada consegue captar os momentos fundamentais da vida do autor e referir, q.b. a sua relação com as obras. É uma narrativa carregada de curiosidades de Philip K. Dick, de leitura interessante, mas que não surpreende em termos visuais. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

I think chapter 5 would be where it starts to heat up, but I got out of the car and have better stories on my nightstand. 📱54% 5:32:47 One minute into Ch. 21 - I dozed off somewhere, and now I'm lost. I know the events, but I'm going back to Chapter 16 for surety. This story is okay, nothing special, but I'm not bored either. 📱73% 7:55:25 Ch. 29 - So I only needed to go back to Ch. 19 but I wasn't mad about rereading all those chapters before it. Unfortunately, it seems like this story is lacking in rising action. Meh. I can't believe they compared this to John Grisham. It's not even a true legal thriller. This story was slow and predictable and anything slightly exciting happened off-camera. There were major plotholes. Recommend to others: Maybe. As a Christian Fiction story it's not bad, as a Legal Thriller it's disappointing. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: Right away, a man dies—either in a hunting accident or murder. A person in the area happens to film another person rushing away. That person is a hiking and trekking pastor, whom you like a lot. Whitlow has written many books and I thought I had read some of them with enjoyment. He does well bringing characters to life and describing the politics of church life and the underbelly of faith. The pastor struggles to give sermons from the heart instead of just from the head and learns more deeply about prayer along the way from some of his congregants. While enjoyable, the storyline was predictable with the author creating sympathetic characters and ones who create dissonance among the others. After the flurry in the Prologue, nothing much really happens for two-thirds of the book and then it careens rapidly down a hill without brakes to a conclusion where all live happily ever after. However, there are some details that are not adequately explained in the skidding stop at the end: a flurry of phone calls on the morning of the death that would have implicated many others. The dead man’s company is struggling but had been publicized a lot and so it’s strange that only two months before his death, the company takes out key-man life insurance policies. They would have taken it out as soon as there were significant sales and contracts that relied on the efforts of the two founders. And the author never explains a discrepancy in the beneficiary of that policy. If the company was well-regarded and well-known, it would have sales and expenses in the nine-figure range. It wouldn’t have survived with a mere eight-figure insurance payout. The company would have needed a bigger payout to transition into a new phases of its business plan without one or both of its founders. If you’re a Whitlow fan, you’ll enjoy the book.

            "⚠ Translation error: This is a spiritual filled legal thriller. Liz Acosta has recently moved to North Georgia, from Florida. There were no good job offers in Florida, therefore she took on a position at the largest law firm in the small town of Bryson. She’s a new lawyer and her ability to speak and understand Spanish makes her a valuable asset to the partners. Unfortunately, she often feels more like a translator than a lawyer, that is until she is assigned a new client, Elena Thompson. Elena is in a rocky marriage compounded by her husband Matt’s two daughter and his ex-wife to whom he is still seems to be committed. The ex-wife, Anne lives in Florida with their two children and the two maintain a friendly long distance relationship. Matt has an apartment where the girls can visit him. Elena, the current desperate wife is trying to cover her bases before things get ugly, and seeks legal advice in the event, she and Matt do divorce. Her husband, Matthew on the surface is a successful businessman with a large bank account. It may be large but there are a lot of demands on his money.   Then we meet Connor Grantham the beloved pastor of a local church in town. He is single and spends his free time in the woods, hiking trails and is out nearly every morning in meditative solitude. He has started counselling with afore mentioned, Matt and Elena Thompson who have some challenging marital issues. That is said lightly. These two are not compatible.   Liz has never been a regular churchgoer until one day her landlord invites her to join her at church on a day when there will be a potluck after the service. Coincidentally, Elena and Matt sporadically also attend Rock Community Church. Yeah small town. Liz continues to attend, and she and Connor become friends and maybe a little more than friends. They enjoy some hikes together, and although they each have a separate relationship with Elena and Matt. The story heats up when there is a hunting event and one of the parishioners is found shot and is dead. Is it murder, suicide? And then the least likely character is suddenly a person of interest.   This is an intriguing, fast-paced story of friendships and faith, jealousy and envy. Mr. Whitlow has well developed characters I could identify with and feel their pain and struggles and their dependency on each other and God I also enjoyed the tangled aspects of the law and how it is used to solve the case. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: As always for books like this spoilers ahead... I know a lot of people want to treat the fourth book as if it doesn't exist so for a moment let's pretend just that. If The Babysitter 3 was the last book, I will say right now that it is perfect. You could probably guess where it might go for going out on a bang in the last installment but if you didn't have any idea...it might just be the best way it could go. Jenny Jeffers is still reeling from the events in the last two books. First, Mr. Hagen tried to kill her because he felt it was his responsibility to punish babysitters who allow bad things to happen to children while they are suppose to be watching them. He is dead and gone but Jenny kept seeing him everywhere and receiving calls where he said he would come back. Turns out her shrink's secretary was jealous of Jenny getting Dr. Schindler's attention and she use to be a patient of his with a sick obsession for the handsome doctor. So she pretended to be Mr. Hagen and listened to the taped recordings of Jenny's sessions to freak the girl out and then tried to kill Jenny at the same quarry. Thankfully, it was now filled with water and Jenny didn't drown. Now, Jenny has been seeing Dr. Schindler a total of two years and she is still having nightmares and gruesome hallucinations of Mr. Hagen coming after her. Her mother has now been laid off from her low paying job and I wouldn't be wasting my money on this guy treating my daughter. Jenny is resigned to getting a summer job working at the mall in a doughnut shop for $4 an hour to help out but she still has her besties, Rick and Claire, and her boyfriend, Cal, she can hang out with. Plus, no more babysitting. Yet another episode of seeing Hagen happens so Jenny's mother thinks it would be a good idea if she get out of Harrison and go visit her cousin Debra in Greenhaven for the summer. At first, Jenny isn't happy about her mom calling her aunt to arrange this behind her back then reluctant mainly because she won't get to be with Cal but also since her mother is now unemployed. Good intentions of a concerned mother win out and Jenny tells Cal in person that she will be away for the summer. Tough guy Cal tries to act like he is angry with Jenny but underneath you can tell he will miss her. He says he'll go with her and try to find a summer job there but Jenny says no and I feel sorry for them both because it's clear Cal loves Jenny and that his home life with his parents isn't very pleasant. We get introduced to Debra making prank phone calls to a guy named Terry, pretending to be his secret admirer. Her ex-boyfriend Don comes in and hears her on the phone and then tries to force a kiss on Debra to take him back. He also threatens to tell Terry and Debra's current boyfriend Mark about her little jokes but Debra isn't having it. At least these Jeffers girls can stand up for themselves if they have to. Jenny hears them fighting and Don runs off awkwardly, Debra saying he is history. The cousins try to catch up but Debra is late for her job and has to leave. Her mother thinks Jenny should go along and that strikes me as odd until...the bombshell. Debra is babysitting for a divorced young mother named Mrs. Wagner, watching her infant son Peter. Jenny handles it surprisingly well but it seems that her aunt and cousin should know that is probably the worst activity the girl could do. Debra eventually realizes how insensitive it was but Jenny assures her that it is fine. Debra's boyfriend Mark shows up after both Jenny and Debra have an encounter with a woman named Maggie. She use to be the housekeeper/babysitter but had to be let go when the Wagners divorced, mostly because she was apparently a thief and clearly a drinker as she comes into the house, drunk off her butt. This woman still has a key or knows where you hide your spare key?! Mark's dad has a friend who owns a horse ranch and needs wranglers to work there for the summer and asks Jenny if she would be interested in doing that once he and Debra learn Jenny was still looking to find a job to help out at home. Jenny agrees and she now helps to get the horses ready for riders, mostly kids and teenagers, which is better than her tagging along to babysitting jobs just to be a third wheel most of the time while Mark and Debra suck face. It seems to be fine but Jenny has another episode of seeing Mr. Hagen again.

            "⚠ Translation error: Review Originally in SCREAM Magazine 2018 “Horror as an art form, as escape, as a rendition of what had just happened, became the only possible response for a world that could not stop screaming.” W. Scott Poole I don’t read a lot of non fiction. I find that in order to get the most out of my recreational reading time, I like to spend hours immersed in the fictional horrors of our talented pool of horror authors authors available to us today. However, when I saw that this book, Wasteland-- a book about the origins of modern horror--written by a historian and a history teacher of horror and pop culture...I couldn’t resist. Especially since I review books for Scream Magazine and I know that the Scream fanbase has mad love for monsters present and monsters past. The perfect non fiction book for me to sink my teeth into. Poole does an excellent job of setting the stage by bringing readers back in time to the early 1900s and the beginning of World War I. But he doesn’t tell the story in the same way I remember being told about it in my high school US history class. These aren’t boring, dry facts you can’t relate to and there’s not a pop quiz at the end of the chapter. There are threads of the early stages of horror woven throughout the World War I history lesson and for me, it made the whole topic insurmountably more engaging. It’s unreal to imagine a time in history where the war machine was churning out corpses by the hundred thousands a year. In total, it claimed the lives of 40 million people over its 4 year duration. Poole then begins to build his case: A post war culture, shaken by what they have seen and what they have lost, find solace in the darkness of horror movies and literature. I found it incredibly interesting to see how the macabre poetry and stories told in the 1920s still resonate in today’s culture as we find ourselves entertained by and almost obsessed with stories of apocalypse and mayhem brought on by some global disease outbreak or zombie takeover. You see this in our movies, books, video games and comics of today but I never really knew why people seem fixated on these self destructive stories. Poole makes the argument that those stories of global catastrophe are an outpouring of emotions that we carry around with us in response to our fears and frustrations about war. I mean, the author doesn’t claim to be a psychologist but his theory makes a lot of sense to me. This book makes well supported claims that fictional horror was born as an affective, creative outlet for a war-torn generation. I thoroughly enjoyed the countless references to all our favorite horror movies and literature spanning over the years between 1920 and and present day. From Nosferatu to Freddy Krueger. I highly recommend this book for any history buff or horror hound. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: Newton Webb never disappoints. His debut collection (great cover, by the way!) includes most of his best stories, spanning a huge amount of time and going through a great variety of settings. Some are novelettes, others more of a typical short story length, always well written, with a fantastic use of the English language. Plotwise, I myself prefer horror tales that pack a punch, and Webb's stories are definitely that! There's a good deal of atmosphere, a quite satisfying narrative tone, calm, balanced, and assured. Webb's strong suit seems to be the great build up of dread and tension, of the slow creeping kind. There's not much gore here, but you will find fast-paced thrills, plus some shocking twists. My personal standouts: - The Hastings Harvest: the story opening the collection; 16th century ghouls, with a great last line! - Rock Bottom - This is not horror, but I loved it just for the language! - The Platinum Service - A terrific story, everything rings true, almost an urban legend type story. - Festival of the Damned - This has to be read by every horror fan! - The Sinful Child - Webb went off the rails here, great ending. - The Black Box - This is a bit unsettling, but I found myself laughing out loud (in a demented way!) Obviously I recommend this collection very highly. I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

Well just know if you get this one, you are going to get a bunch of fucked-up horror stories that make you itch to read the next one. So many bases get covered, from survival horror to demonic entities to body horror to AI to extremely expensive sex addictions. You do get a little bit of everything, all masterfully told and EXTREMELY British. (I had to google so many words and was tickled at each new word/phrase I learned.) Some standout stories for me: “Succession,” but the people you want to die actually do, the kid gang fighting an age-old demon, the $2500 gloryhole, and the 18th century cannibals.

No!!!! i didn't feel the connection between both Main characters. you would think that because they had two years of history there love for each other would just click into place and then suddenly insta love. but nooooooo it was dragged out through out the whole book and then it was completely rushed towards the end. then there was the story about his parents. it's okay to write a brief history about his parents and from what i saw there is a book about his parent's past why the hell did you put it into this book!!?? this was suppose to be Rayne and Christa story not Luke and Emily' s story!! so what was the point of all that??! from what it is said int he review the books after this one gets better so i suggest you just skip or perhaps skim through this one and move onto the other ones and save yourselves the confusion. i hope the books do get better so i will be moving to the next one hoping that i could feel different about this series. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: This collection features 16 short stories of chilling horror! There's a little bit for everyone! From ghosts, to cannibals, to murder, even some love...this is a collection you don't want to miss! Hard to choose a favourite but I will narrow it down to 3: 1) The black fog: The ancient fishing village has slowly lost people without a word. Ted's mom passed away and he was left living with his dad who still thinks she's alive. When rumors of the black fog start, are the village people safe from it? Or will they also vanish without a trace? - This was a fun one! Seeing the dead clme back to live when the fog rolls in wass fun! I definitely enjoyed this one! Spooky, fun, and I got in my feels at times 2) The Platinum Service: Oliver has just started a new job at a fancy company. In order to make it, he noticed that he's gotta be included with the big boys of the company. A couple of nights out, sleeping with women should do it. After endless nights out with the boys, drinking and fucking, Oliver decides to pay a big amount of money for a single 1 time service. Of coarse he doesn't listen and with that comes a big problem! - This was probably at the top for me! I loved this story so much! I love a good glory hole and this delivered satisfaction and pain in the best way! Loved it! 3) The Black Box: Jack died. Then he woke up. Well, what was left of him. Jack was an organ donor and when he had his fatal crash, his brain was donated. He never thought he would awake and be used for experimenting. - Another really good one! I LOVED this, makes you question! I highly suggest this fun, yet dark horror story collection. Webb is an excellent author! --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: This creepy collection of one-panel stories was absolutely perfect! Each page is its own little eerie story that gives you an introduction to a greater narrative of your own choosing. As a child, I loved the book The Mysteries of Harris Burdick by Chris Van Allsburg which gave you pictures and a one-sentence prompt, and this graphic novel does the same. Joe Hill, of Locke & Key fame (and fellow IDW author), gives an introduction, so be on the lookout for one of the later illustrations to pay homage to his series. As a librarian, the picture set in the library made me pause…you never know what lurks around the corner behind a bookshelf! Other favorites of mine included any cemetery image, the girl building a puzzle, the boy retrieving his ball, the old man with his birthday cake, the thief in the hallway of portraits, and the last picture of a long-limbed animal in the woods. Make sure you check out Coldrick’s art at his Tapas site ( https://tapas.io/series/Behind-You/info ) for more horror one-shots, some of which are animated gifs!

            "⚠ Translation error: People are a peculiarly judgmental tribe. Everyone judges and, while intellectually it is often based on the latest bylaws laid out by the rampant political correctness of the day, emotionally it’s an entire story altogether. Which is to say if people like something or someone well enough, they’ll find a way to separate the art from the artist and enjoy the former while reviling the latter. There’s a reason a director who found guilty of having sex with one teenager once (a teenager who grew up to outspokenly forgive him, mind) gets banished from the country while certain public figures commit far greater and often infinitely creepier wrongs and get away with it. It’s all about how much you care. Who do you love, baby? ABC, it’s easy as one, two, three. Michael Jackson is simply too good of an artist, there’s simply too strong of an emotional connection with his music, to dismiss right out, despite all the alleged (see, there, alleged) crimes he may have committed. I’ve not actually jumped on this insanely popular bandwagon of true crime documentary serials, but did watch the recent Jackson one with two young men with tears in their eyes describing how Jacko traumatized them with his love. Add that to the other accusers (cases that got dismissed and paid off) and there’s simply too much smoke to not be any fire. But then you hear Billie Jean and your feet start tapping. You see Jackson do a moonwalk and your mind is blown. The songs get stuck on repeat in your mind. It’s still that good, still holds up after all these years. Performers like Jackson come along once in the bluest of moons. And we forgive them a lot. But maybe not as much as this book does. This obsequiously fawning biography has outdone itself on the forgive and forget spectrum. Someone must have had the sale on whitewash, because boy oh boy, did they whitewash this thing. And no, it isn’t a stab at the fact that MJ started life as a black man and ended it as a white woman facsimile. Another fairly odd factor that the book avoids discussing. A lot of it might be down to the act that this is a French book and the French are notoriously more permissive when it comes to certain things. They have, after all, welcomes Polanski and just look at the long career Luc Besson has enjoyed. So it’s entirely possible that they are just very comfortable and happy with MJ as he was and are perfectly willing to explain away any controversial aspects. The Frenchness of it also might explain the weird attempts to present Jackson as a sort of playboy or ladies men. No, no, and no. His most significant relationships were with older mommy types celebs, like Diana Ross (possibly the weirdest one in there for a boy who already technically had a mother). So, as far as biographies go, this is a reasonably comprehensive, albeit insanely biased, one. It follows Jackson along from early childhood to death, with all the significant events inbetween. It concentrates heavily on his horribly abusive father. It presents (quite rightly) Jackson as a musical genius and a savvy businessman (buying up that Beatles catalog straight from under his pal Paul), negotiating with MTV for representation, etc. It barely grazes on his kids and how weird, weird, weird that entire thing was. It features Neverland heavily, and it’s worth mentioning that in a dream sequence with Pan discussing Neverland, Pan is, oddly enough, shirtless. And it focuses heavily on how much MJ loved kids (the right way) and how many charities he had donated to. Which is all really great, but to paraphrase the old joke, it doesn’t matter if you give away millions of dollars to charity, you molest one kid and you’re a pedo for life. Except, in France, that is. So that’s content. The rest …well, the book is structured like this, a biographical essay and a comic about it, over and over again. The essays as mentioned are biased, the comics are plain ugly. All except for the last one and the fun one with the chimp Bubbles. Just ugly, grotesque and at times caricaturish enough to be taken as offensive. The sum total leaves a lot, a lot, to be desired. It might be educational for some who doesn’t know a thing about Jackson if such a person can be found in this day and age, but it isn’t a great or even an accurate representation of a complex character, who for all his faults, remains the King of Pop.

            "⚠ Translation error: 3 stars. This was fairly enjoyable, but quite flawed. Aaron Lopresti ends up taking over the art from Jason Fabok and it is pretty good. There is a Jim Gordon Zero Year story in here that is good. It shows him dealing with the crooked GCPD and they try to throw him off a bridge but Batman rescues him and it is basically the start of their relationship. Then there is a story that sort of wraps up the Man-Bat stuff as Batman works with Kirk Langstrom to locate his wife, who has been the really dangerous one. Then the main story is Gothtopia, which was a fun read, but it really does not make any sense. Everybody in Gotham is in this state of contentment, and you get some neat, more whimsical takes on some characters. Batman is supposedly nice and happy with Catwoman and there is very little crime in Gotham. Everyone took down Poison Ivy because she was saying this is all a lie. Batman eventually realizes this is all fake and he plays along with it to find the culprit. Turns out Scarecrow has poisoned the whole city into this peaceful state, that way he can do his fear toxin on people to get a more pure fear release. I like that concept, except this initial contentment toxin is supposedly making everyone see what they want to see, so how on earth is everyone having the exact same vision and functioning as a society?? Because of her powers, Ivy is not affected by any of this, and Batman teams with her to save the day, and I enjoyed them having to work together. The other major problem is Crane takes Batman into Arkham, which is fine, but at no point do him or the villains he is working with try to unmask Batman or kill him. I struggle to see how they made no attempt. Ultimately Batman creates an antidote and saves the day after playing along for a while and Crane ends up in Arkham. Fun concept with some good moments, but actually made no sense when you think about it. Lastly there was a special for issue 27 to celebrate the original Detective Comics 27. A bunch of meaningless short stories are in here. As expected, these range from bad to enjoyable, with the art also ranging from bad to good, but none of it matters. Overall solid volume that had its moments. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: Po naprawdę fajnym trzecim tomie, spadku formy przy okazji Wrath, oczekiwałem ponownie naprawdę dobrej intrygi. W końcu dorobku Laymana jest The Chew, ale widać, że autor niezbyt dobrze \"czuję\" Batmana przez co następny tom powierzono już komuś innemu (a to nie ostatnia zmiana). Takie podmienianie autorów z jednej strony zapewnia różnorodność stylu, ale i stawia pod znakiem zapytania ogólną jakoś, a seria Detective Comics pod egidą New 52 do tych z najwyższych lotów nie należy. Początkowy zeszyt to chyba najlepsze co ma do zaoferowania cały tom. To historia Jamesa Gordona, z czasów kiedy dopiero zaczynał pracę i wszędzie miał pod górę. Jako jedyny nieprzekupny glina musiał się zmierzyć z ogólną niechęcią, z jaką darzyli go zarówno współpracownicy czy przełożeni. Tu też zaczyna się współpraca z Batmanem i Bullockiem. Niemniej praworządność doprowadzi tutaj Gordona nad przepaść... którą zobaczy z mostu. Potem jest mniej ciekawie. Kontynuacja zamieszania jakie wywołał Man-Bat swoim serum jest zwyczajnie nuda. Coraz częściej w mieście dochodzi do makabrycznych znalezisk, przyjmujące formę wysuszonych z krwi zwłok. Trop wiedzie do żony naukowca, co też nie jest spoilerem, gdyż przy okazji poprzedniego tomu wiadomo, iż łyknęła ona nieco zmodyfikowane serum i bawi się z ludźmi nieco inaczej niż mąż. Z ulgą przywitałem clue tomu, czyli tytułową Gothtopie. Niestety dobrze zapowiadająca się fabuła okazała się tak przewidywalna jak myślałem. Utopijna wizja miasta, w którym nie ma zwariowanych przestępców, a odsetek występków sięga prawie zera, była czymś świeżym i interesującym, zwłaszcza że herosi wyglądają nieco inaczej, a i noszą inne imiona. Bawiła mnie ta zmiana barw z czerni na biel, ale jak zwykle to bywa, dalszy rozwój fabuły poszedł w sztampę. Twórca ponownie sięga po Stracha na Wróble (który był już nadużyty w serii The Dark Knight), co było moją pierwszą myślą, jeżeli chodzi o to kto mógł za całą hecą stać. Pojmanie Batmana, rola Poison Ivy, wygląd sidekicków Wayne'a w szatach \"Stracha\". To były plusy reszty zeszytów i aż mnie dziw bierze, dlaczego nie zabito tu Batka, mimo przewagi jaką mieli Ci źli. Naprawdę, taka okazja się nie trafia w zasadzie, aby Wayne był bezbronny, ale w trakcie lektury oczywiście dowiemy się, iż większość zajść była już z góry zaplanowana. Naiwne było też \"użycie\" Batka do pozyskiwania esencji strachu od randomowych ludzi (w ciemno zakład poszedł, że to byli jacyś przestępcy...) i nie zakładanie, że Batman nie oprze się działaniu nowej toksyny Stracha... Takie naiwności fabularne psuły mi odbiór, tym bardziej że w końcu następuje ta prezencja Gothtopia jako jednego z ważniejszych wydarzeń, ale Nocy Sów to butów nie czyści nawet. Czułem zawód i to spory. Nawet fajne, króciutkie historyjki nawiązujące do klimatu przygód Batmana na przełomie dawnych lat (75 rocznica \"urodzin \" postaci) nie są w stanie wywindować oceny na lepszą. Graficznie bywa naprawdę różnie. Były momenty naprawdę fajne, ale w większość była to zwykła \"wyrobnicza\" krecha. Fabok się nie popisał. Gothtopia rozciąga się też na kilka innych serii, ale jest tam równie nudna jak w omawianym tomie. Można to przeczytać, ale po co skoro zaraz obok mamy serię Batman i będę rekomendował o sięgnięcie po tamte zeszyty, przynajmniej do siódmego tomu. 2.5/5 --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: I read few comics and graphic novels but I appreciate those times I read and feel pleasure and disappointment with them. With its glossy and expensive paper, comic artists had become sensational or some may be inferior because of their short and minimal strips and limited paper to draw in. From that small piece of paper, they shared their experiences, happiness, corniness and everything from them that they want to share from every individual. The Best of American Comics 2011 is a collection of comics and excerpt from different graphic novels taken online to support webcomics and self-published comics; they manage to collect the best art, story and plot of artists that sent their works and to reproduce to be called as real comics . I don't have any idea of those artists or the editors that manage to conduct and scanned all mistakes but the best thing about this book is the forward that inspires everyone to write and publish their own comics. 'Comics is a printed medium. And now it’s also a digital medium. What it isn’t is a direct medium, like drawing or painting: there is no “original” comic to read. The pages that have the ink on them may be beautiful to look at and they may offer loads of information for fans and researchers, but most people will agree that it’s not really a comic until it has been reproduced.' Below are the best among best webcomics and self-publishes comics reproduced, those are the strips that manage to fall my tears, give me laughs and inspire me to draw colorful things inside my head. 1. Manifestation by Gabrielle Bell - This comic made my day, swear, everything blown away and I fall asleep dreaming of the Scum manifestation . An artist, drunk, talks about making a comic strip about the book and she made a huge impression to the public. The problem is how? She called her mom and she learned something, something important that I don't like to spill. Which everyone already have the answer inside. 2. Queen by Michael Deforge - I love this metaphysical story of an alien looking for weird plants and animals, pulling everything she needed to become a queen. In the end, she got the filial look of an ugly queen with weird skinless animal. Weirder than what I've thought. 3. Flower Mecha by Angie Wang - Vintage style art, very clever and had intelligent plot. She uses science of pollination to create a very powerful female superhero that can control a huge flower. Kudos for the art! 4. November 3, 1956 by Joe Sacco - I cried when I read this 2 part comics. This is a collection of true to life story about what happen in November 3, 1956 and the innocent Arabs that had been killed by the Israel soldiers. Remembering the past with the memories that we want to forget but no matter how hard we erase them, they keep on coming back. Hunted. 5. Little House in the Big City by Sabrina Jones - In 1950 housing renovation and real estate is getting better and businessmen, architects, etc. are planning to change everything. They don't know, they destroy happiness from every home and every neighborhood they lured. And Jane Jacob save the day! 6. Anatomy of a Pratfall by Peter and Maria Hoey - Wordless. Pure boxes with things that we usually seen in our everyday life. Pictures that tell there own stories and a map of a pure tragedy, action and epicness. 7. Winter by Danica Novgodorrodov , Benjamin Percy and James Ponsoldt - I did not understand the whole story, it was an excerpt from a graphic novel which I'm not familiar with. I include this in my favorites because the watercolor art is very amazing, it was an abstract and never imagine that things will happen vividly like a dream. 8. The Ultimate Graphic Novel by David Lasky - This is the most challenging part of the comic artist, giving them only six panels to draw and David Lasky did a great job. I was so shocked that I finish this page in just a second and I admit that I want more. I remember when I was in Elementary my teacher force us to make a comic strip in 3 panels and I got a big 'D' on the top corner of my work. Better luck next time for me. The disappointing part is that I can't read some of the comics because they are pixilated, words are too small and lastly some are very confusing. They have different style, different story and different concept but in the end of the day, everything sets at the same time. Photo taken from the book on page 7 in Manifestation by Gabrielle Bell.

            "⚠ Translation error: Amelia Fischer has never been “in.” She’s never made a close group of friends or hosted spontaneous sleepovers. She’s never been “in” because she’s always been “out,” as in, one foot always outside the door. Amelia’s mom has a tough job in nursing homes and has to travel almost every year. Along with her devoted and loving sister, Mae, Amelia’s never gotten close to a place like home. This time, though, she feels that it might be different. Morristown is safe, secure, and happy. They have finally stayed for three years and counting, and Amelia is about to take a shot at a huge opportunity: the First Singles spot on the tennis team. Sophie Graham has always been circled by a group of friends, two over-caring parents and the support of the town she’s lived in since birth. Considering her perfect home, beauty and connections within her community, she has always been “in.” Which is why it’s important for her to maintain her tennis game and First Singles spot against her newer teammate. Other than their love and skill at tennis, Amelia and Sophie have never had any similarities, or even reasons to interact with each other. This is before the night after the challenge match changes everything. When Amelia’s car breaks down and a mysterious figure moves to “help” her, things go wrong and Sophie’s car crashes into her landing both girls in the hospital. When Amelia finally wakes up, she quickly realizes something is wrong. Only vaguely familiar people are hugging her and crying, her toenails and skin tone are the wrong color and her thoughts don’t seem to connect. She realizes that she’s not Amelia. She’s the girl who beat Amelia in a tennis match and crashed into her on a state road. She’s Sophie Graham. As Amelia (in Sophie Graham’s body) begins to piece together the puzzle of how she got where she is and how to get back to the real Amelia, more and more questions come to mind. Amelia begins to lose herself to Sophie, while grasping to discover what happened that crazy night and why some parts of her puzzle don’t fit anymore. With strength, courage and dedication, Amelia learns more about her past along with more about Sophie’s. She realizes that the walls on the outside may not show the faded memories locked on the inside. In NOW YOU SEE HER, connections begin to unravel and it leads Sophie and Amelia both reaching through faith to find each other. As a fellow teenage reader, I would be lying if I didn’t say that I gasped multiple times or said “Oh my God, WHAT?!!!” in the reading of this book. My parents definitely became a little scared of all the times I just stopped reading and said “OH NO.” The book was captivating and energetic. It twisted me around like a pool towel. For example, it would let me dry out for a chapter or two, then soak me in new information to create a better complex mystery. Then it would flip me around with a surprising plot twist (these are the super loud gasps I’m talking about). One of my favorite parts of the book was how connected I became to the characters; they were very real and became very personal. I could confirm this when I started to shake and cry at the end and in the epilogue. I enjoyed every plot twist and every time a new string would lead back to something I read in the very beginning. I don’t know about personal opinions on cliffhangers, but the author really created some surprises for the last few chapters --- and then the story was fully explained in the best form possible (no spoilers!). I thoroughly enjoyed this part because the author revealed different layers from details I had forgotten about buried deep within the story. There were few points of negativity I had for NOW YOU SEE HER. One thing that confused me was that some of the memories or instances where Sophie’s “soul,” shall we say, and Amelia’s soul couldn’t be distinguished. I would have to read the section and the section before more than once to figure out whose perspective I’m thinking from. Another thing that may be seen negatively were some of the cliché parts of it, especially in the middle area. There were times where I got frustrated about how often I’ve seen similar stories with the “switching bodies” and the depression or realization of “Oh, her life isn’t as glamorous as it seems” themes. As I got closer to the end, the story went a lot deeper than those other books and the negative thoughts faded away. What I’m saying is, don’t stop reading because you think you’ve heard it before, I promise that it ge --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: Shadow of Intrigue is the second book in the Lantern Beach Romantic Suspense series. If you haven't read any of the other Lantern Beach books, that's fine. This book stands alone great. I think I like Lisa even more after this book. She's sweet and super likeable. She was my favorite supporting character in the Lantern Beach Mysteries so it was great to finally get her story. She's this quirky chef who comes up with all kinds of unique flavor combinations that just somehow work and are totally delicious. I want her to be my friend. She's awesome. Braden was an interesting character. He's paranoid but has every right to be. Someone's trying to kill him. There's been multiple attempts on his life and with his memory acting up, he feels like he's losing his mind and starts to wonder what's real and what's not. I really liked him. He's struggling but trying so hard to overcome it all. I couldn't help but root for him. Shadow of Intrigue was a little slower paced than previous books but in no way does that mean it was any less great.

Their romance was crazily fast. But I did find it sweet. Probably because of Braden’s struggles. There was a lot of prayer in this book. Second chances and hope. Again, I did wish she used Scripture to back up some of the promises because otherwise it just seems like a psychiatrist’s pep-y’all (not trying to be harsh here). And the bad guy? I pieced it together about 2/3 in, wishing I was wrong. It was well done there.

            "⚠ Translation error: Shadow of Intrigue is the second book in the Lantern Beach Romantic Suspense series. Christy Barritt gave it to me in exchange for an honest review. Cassidy and Ty are our of town to celebrate his mother's birthday. Braden Dillinger is using their place while he is recovering from being hurt in the service. Physically, he seems to be mostly OK, but he has tremors and memory issues, including blackouts. This causes him to have trouble in this town. Lisa Garth, owner of the Crazy Chefette, is planning to act as his hostess. Their relationship starts out horribly. Braden then gets helpful at the restaurant, even taste-testing new recipes. There is some romance, but even that goes sour because of his memory lapses. Much danger and suspense fills the pages of this book. Things become more ominous with each chapter. I like that the characters pray during scary times. Then, they give thanks when things are better. Most everyone likes Lisa's unusual concoctions, but a man named John Linski is violently critical. This frightens Lisa. Braden is being threatened by someone, too. He thinks a terrorist group wants to kill him. Read this book to find out what happens!

            "⚠ Translation error: I had mixed feelings going into this story. I was looking forward to it because I had so enjoyed and connected with Lisa during the Lantern Beach Mysteries series so wanted to see her story play out. On the other hand, I had also been looking forward to Austin and Skye's story in the previous book Tides of Deception , and the ending of that greatly disappointed me (I'm hoping the author will change that ending!!!) so I was hoping I wasn't going to get another disappointment again! I didn't. I did figure out the plot and what was going on as it is very similar to one of Christy Barritt's Cape Thomas books, but the characters, setting and scenario were different enough that I was still kept interested enough to keep reading and see how it was all going to unfold. Braden was a perfect match for Lisa! My one complaint is that Lisa only opens her restaurant for 2 days during the off-season, and one of the days she chooses is a Sunday!? (Keep the Sabbath is one of the 10 commandments, and with Lisa being a Christian it seemed sensible she would hold to that. I know some who have to work on a Sunday do keep a separate day of the week special, but that wasn't mentioned as something Lisa did.) Plus, she closes to have her friends over for a Sunday meal. (Huh - is she open or not?) So I was a bit confused there. Otherwise a great suspense on our favourite Lantern Beach! --> No translation was found using the current translator.

Of course, this means leaving her long-time boyfriend at home. But the prospect of a new setting and a job in a fancy house with her own car, cell phone, and private suite will soften that blow. Jo gets along famously with her new employers and her three charges, and all seems to be going wonderfully... until her employer's grown-up (and very attractive) son from a previous marriage moves back home - and into Jo's suite. Jo can't figure Josh out. Sometimes they seem to be friends, and other times he seems to hate her. And on top of everything else, she's pretty sure that Josh is helping his father hide a secret from the rest of the family - a secret that she finds impossible to forgive. But, as Jo is soon to find out, Josh may not be the only one harboring a secret. Such fun chick-lit!

Maybe there’s a reason I didn’t gel with these books as a kid - because they’re pretty dull. I was intrigued by this one because it had a concept I usually enjoy: deadly games. But the characters were all a bit pathetic and the main ‘scandal’ wasn’t something I can really envision anyone being upset about, much less an entire town of people going out of their way to make a teenager’s life hell. And the end? The poor girl just gets tossed off a balcony and nobody gives a crap. Also, Cass’s game honestly wasn’t even that mean. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: I could never think about ever changing my five star rating for this book. Along with The Accident, this is the other Diane Hoh book that was one of my first not counting anything in Nightmare Hall. I never get tired of the characters good or bad and I never get tired of the reveals. True some of the cliches of the genre are present but it is a touch entertaining with the crazy teens and suspenseful tone. Cassandra Rockham is the most popular, the richest girl in Greenhaven and her annual Fall Party is around the corner. Some would kill to be invited but Sarah Drew isn't one of them. She knows how snobby Cass can be as well as some of her crowd, those rich kids who live up in the hills, and Sarah is fine with her small group of friends and her studying and her violin. When the ivory envelope arrives with her name in gold, Sarah is suspicious as well as confused. In all the time she has known Cass, Sarah has never been invited to a party at her home so why now in junior year all of a sudden. Her best friends, Maggie Delaney and Eleanor \"Ellie\" Whittier are more than thrilled to be invited. Redheaded Maggie is a friendly drum majorette and Ellie is the blonde girl who is slightly chubby and lives under the shadow of her pretty, skinny older sister Ruth so to be invited to rich girl Cass' party doesn't seem that strange to them. The only boy in their circle, Donald Neeson, is tall and lanky and smart but also cute and pretty talented at basketball. Making the team now may be the reason why his friends got invited but Donald is only interested in attending if Maggie goes, realizing over the summer just how crazy he is about her. Shane Magruder is new in town but she gotten taken under Maggie's wing the moment she arrived and now the other four are the best friends she could ask for. Not exactly thrilled, Shane will go if her friends decide to go. Sarah gives in mostly because Shane convinces her but knowing her mother would have a fit at her going to a party instead of worrying about her grades is one reason. Riley White is the other one. He's in Cass' circle but she has seen him smile and with the way Riley's eyes set it off in his handsome features, Sarah is sure he couldn't be as snobby or as vile as Cassandra Rockham. So the girls go out and buy nice dresses but Ellie gets hers ruined by her older sister Ruth pouring purple nail polish out of not being invited herself. Ruth tells Ellie it's a mistake and she will have an awful time... Donald has his own troubles. He met a girl named Dolly being a counselor at summer camp with her and they had a romance as you sometimes do. They don't live close and well, Maggie got a tan and her braces off while Donald was gone. He tries to let Dolly down easy over the phone but she isn't too thrilled or happy. Donald didn't mention anyone specifically but Dolly knows it has to be someone else he's dumping her for... Shane goes to the party with the others in a new dress and despite her nice features and being with her very best friends...there is something in the back of her mind that could ruin her evening. The real reason that her family moved from Rockport to Greenhaven isn't what it seems and if anyone knew about her past...Shane would die of embarrassment. Maggie hopes for a romantic night getting closer to Donald and some of her excitement rubs off on Sarah just a little. Riley White will be at the party and perhaps it is Sarah's chance to get to know him better. Despite being in Cassandra Rockham's house with the hostess from hell, how bad could the party really be? If only they could know just what is in store when they arrive... A game planned for fun at the ridicule of others, normal high school pranks of winners against the social losers, is about to turn into something far more horrifying. So horrifying that it's deadly... Teens really are evil and it is just so much fun to see a few characters get their digs in at the truly awful Cass. The only one to top her in being one of the worst characters in this book gets an excuse because well it just wouldn't be a normal Point Horror without someone being a few crayons short of the box... The ending after the fraught with tension climax is bittersweet and ends with your own thoughts as to how any of the characters can bounce back. For me, I want the happy side of the coin to turn up but that's just wishful thinking I suppose... The Invitation may just be another YA/teen drama in the long roster of books but it is not too trash --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",
            "⚠ Translation error: The Invitation is similar to Diane Hoh's other Point Horror books that I've read thus far - especially Funhouse - in that it has a very impressive opening chapter. And then it all goes silly quite quickly because Hoh seems to just love to throw in an unnecessary amount of characters. Although, I will say that having lots of characters has worked best in The Invitation so far. The narrative jumps between five main characters - Sarah (our main protagonist), Ellie, Maggie, Donald, and Shane. Unlike, say, Joe Abercrombie's The Blade Itself , where the the story is told from different characters but the writing style clues you in to who you're following, here Hoh doesn't really provide much of a distinction in how each character is written. They're all pretty much interchangeable, except for Shane... Throughout the book, Shane's narration teases at a mysterious event from her past. It's built up and then the reveal is laughably underwhelming. There are also some narrative threads that are pretty much unsatisfyingly abandoned by the time the book ends. Speaking of the ending, it is very rushed and not particularly great. Admittedly it's not as bad as the ending to The Girlfriend , but at least that book had a very enjoyable journey getting there. I do like the concept here, but the execution is lacking. 2.5/5 Point Horror Ranked 1) The Girlfriend - 4/5 2) Trick or Treat - 3.5/5 3) Teacher's Pet - 3.5/5 4) The Baby-Sitter II - 3.5/5 5) The Cheerleader - 3.5/5 6) April Fools - 3.5/5 7) My Secret Admirer - 3.5/5 8) The Lifeguard - 3.5/5 9) Thirteen Tales of Horror - 3/5 10) The Accident - 3/5 11) Funhouse - 3/5 12) The Invitation - 2.5/5 13) The Boyfriend - 2/5 14) Mother's Helper - 2/5 15) The Baby-Sitter - 1.5/5 16) Beach Party - 1/5 --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: One-Line Review: Life is one big quest, and the geek shall inherit the earth. Full Review: I didn’t own this book as a child, and only borrowed it from a friend once until I collected the entire Point Horror series (or imprint, rather) for the kids I was looking after when I was 28. So it’s a bit surprising to me that it’s one of my favourites. Typically my favourite Point Horrors are ones that I read and loved as a kid, and have good memories attached to. In The Invitation , Sarah and her group of friends are startled to receive invitations to rich bitch Cass Rockham’s annual fall party. While they’re not exactly loner losers, they’re also definitely not in the popular crowd, so why have they suddenly received invites? Sarah is sceptical, but her friends convince her to attend the party, where it soon becomes clear that their hostess has nefarious purposes. I don’t think I’ve come across another Point Horror book where almost all of it takes place in the space of a few hours, and I really enjoyed the format. As a natural-born hunter/collector, I’m always on the lookout for a new quest, and the scavenger hunt plot really appealed to me, as did the puzzle-within-a-puzzle aspect. I usually enjoy Diane Hoh’s heroines, and Sarah was no exception. She’s quiet and serious, but ballsy when necessary. Smart enough to figure out how to free herself, tough enough to rescue her friends and stand up to Cass. There’s enough going on in this book that I tend to forget who the villain is, which I kind of like! It makes it feel fresh every time I read it. Verdict: Enjoyable format, neat protagonist. I’m surprised I never bought this as a kid! --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: Terri Reed is one of those suspense writers who throws her audience (or readers) right smack in the middle of the action. That is exactly what she does in “Forced to Hide” and I love it! From the start, you can feel the tension as Judge Adele Weston prepares to enter her courtroom right up to the moment the first bomb goes off. Chaos ensues afterwards as you would expect! Enter our hero, Brian Forrester, who is assigned to protect Adele & stick by her side no matter what. She certainly doesn’t make it easy on him to do his job, but must cooperate so he can find the bomber & person behind subsequent attacks. Will they be successful or will time run out like the ticking of a bomb (pun intended)? This one has all the elements of a suspense story that I love; tense action, edge-of-your-seat roller coaster ride feeling, and the fun of solving who the bad guy is. Reed kept me on my toes trying to figure it out! What I also love about Inspirational suspense is the faith thread & there was no lack of it here. Especially as Adele clung to her faith in God when things became downright dangerous! She would have to trust that God would see her through this. Her faith in Jesus had never let her down. Sometimes her faith was the only way she managed to get through the day. ~page 62 It reminds me that I, too, can trust God in my deepest needs and my faith in Jesus will sustain me no matter what. I love when authors remind me of these truths! Faith, hope and love are strong themes in “Forced to Hide” along with a story to keep your heart racing & turning pages! *I received a complimentary copy from the author.

            "⚠ Translation error: Fascinating and illuminating book that is both scholarly with some elements of the personal in which Borg chronicles his own evolving Christianity and relationship with Jesus as well as teaching the lessons of his 30 years of work and study as a Biblical scholar. Ultimately, Borg offers an extremely useful and informative book both looking at how beliefs and understandings of who Jesus was have been in a constant state of change since his death, but also of how a historical/metaphorical reading of Jesus and the Bible can open the door to a deeply meaningful religious experience and Christianity. That believing in Jesus's literal divinity/resurrection isn't the necessary litmus test to being Christian. In this book, he unpacks what we know of Jesus as a man, a teacher of \"alternative wisdom,\" that challenged the conventional wisdom of the age (and still challenges it) and that he was a not just a wisdom teacher, but the \"Wisdom of God,\" Sophia (the gendered FEMALE personification of God's wisdom. That he didn't need to be the literal son of God (and, indeed, Borg unpacks how little shows that Jesus ever thought he was - as part of this, he unpacks how the book of John in the Bible is non-literal speech of Jesus), but rather Jesus spoke and taught of a deeply personal relationship he had with God, that others could seek as well. In that, Jesus was a \"highly spiritual person,\" for whom God was an experiential reality. I would do a disservice trying to paraphrase Borg's book here, because his ideas and arguments build on one another, with lots of examples and backing for his claims. The ultimate lesson though, from Borg, is that reading and understanding Jesus in this historical and metaphorical way, in no way diminishes his power or in the believer's Christianity. This is, I'm sure, a way of understanding Jesus that is heretical to many fundamentalists, but it is a way of understanding Jesus that can be powerful for other Christians, and a way toward \"being transform[ed] into more and more compassionate beings, 'into the likeness of Christ.'\" (136) However, while this is in no way an attempt to reconstruct the research and arguments of this book, here are a few excerpts to give a taste for the book: \"rather than being the exclusive revelation of God, [Jesus] is one of many mediators of the sacred,\" (37) --- i.e. this understanding allows you to a Christian pluralist, i.e. all the worlds Buddhists, Muslims, Jews, atheists, etc., aren't going to hell because they were raised non-Christians. There are many ways to approach God, and Jesus and Christianity is one of those very real, and very valid, ways. In this type of understanding, \"Christian life moves beyond believing in God to being in a relationship to God.\" (39) On the Bible and Bible stories: \"Since they were originally oral stories, we should not think of them as the set pieces we have in the gospels, recited word for word.\" (86) And that the reason and power of pursuing a relationship with God through Jesus is that: \"A relationship with God leads from anxiety to a life of peace and trust. It leads from bondage of self-protection to the freedom of self-forgetfullness. It leads from life centered in culture to life centered in God.\" (88) He concludes with this statement that: \"Belief did not originally mean believing in a set of doctrines or teaching; in both Greek and Latin its roots mean to 'give one's heart to.' The 'heart' is the self at its deepest level. Believing, therefore, does not consist of giving one's mental assent to something, but involves a much deeper level of one's self. Believing in Jesus does not mean believing doctrines about him. Rather, it means to give one's heart, one's self at its deepest level, to the post-Easter Jesus who is the living Lord, the side of God turned toward us, the face of God, the Lord who is also the Spirit.\" (137) And also that: \"It is an image of the Christian life not primarily as believing or being good but as a relationship with God. That relationship does not leave us unchanged but transforms us into more and more compassionate beings, 'into the likeness of Christ.'\" (136) So, in a lot of ways, Borg articulates a Christianity that is unlike the one in which fundamentalist believe in. I wish every fundamentalist would read this book, not that they would all open their minds to the arguments here, or agree with all of them, but that they should at least open their minds to these ideas, because ultimately, regardless of --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: Marcus Borg is a heretic - he denies the orthodox doctrines of the virgin birth, the divinity of Christ, etc. OK, now that's out of the way let me tell you why I enjoyed this book despite its serious flaws. Borg provides an autobiographical account of his own journey from child-like faith through adolescent skepticism to adult rejection and then back to an identification as, I guess, a \"Christian\" (although I would argue his view of ideal Christianity more closely represents a New Age spirituality dressed with the terminology of Christianity. His account felt real and demonstrated good self-awareness and I empathised with him. The things he rejected in his evangelical Lutheran upbringing are the things I recoil from in contemporary evangelicalism. When he talks about the Christian life as a transformational journey in relationship with God I think all my colleagues and I would agree with him - except that he doesn't use those words with the sort of meanings that orthodox Christians would use those words to mean. (E.G. God is more of a life-force that is immanent in all the universe and transcends the material plane, but is never described in terms of personhood, so how can there be a \"relationship\" if God is not a person?) Borg, as a leading Jesus scholar, obviously has a wide breadth of knowledge about the historical background and there were a few pieces of information that were new to me. That was good. I disagreed, obviously, with the image of Jesus he constructed with them. Unsurprisingly, I largely agree with his four broad strokes of the picture of Jesus: 1. a \"spirit person\" (i.e. someone who has a direct relationship with God and mediates that experience to others so they can have a direct relationship with God - an insightful way of describing the power of Jesus' ministry even if Borg's terms all have different meanings that my meanings for those terms); 2. a \"teacher of wisdom\" (i.e. God's wisdom rather than conventional wisdom, although again Borg goes too far in contrasting these two. I think it is best to think of a both/and rather than either/or scenario) 3. a \"social prophet\" (i.e. challenged the existing social order to advocate for, in my orthodox words, kingdom values) 4. a \"movement founder\" (his expansion of this I found the most disappointing, probably because I love to think about Jesus' movement and the implications for today). So, this book is written at a serious but popular level and Borg is clear enough when he rejects orthodox positions that I was able to enjoy the read and pick out the bits of value in it. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

But of course, he had. 👮‍♀️ The lift 👮‍♂️ -2/5 The innocent disappearance of a child quickly turns gruesome when police discover a tasteful revelation. Their are too many unnecessary details given by the detective earlier in the story. However, the notion of a child going missing in a closed lift was a haunting and engaging idea. It would have been better if the cannibals had planned kidnapping Eric. For example, a lady at the toy store he visits gives Eric a coded treasure map to follow in order to win his favourite toy. Members of the group Eric meets along the way, check he’s weight, height etc . In the end, he makes his way through the back door of a expensive restaurant where he is never seen again. Police have to interrupt guests enjoying their meals and tell them the disgusting truth about what they are eating. In my own spin-off, I would have had parents report the death of their son at the shopping mall. After a investigation is carried out, it is declared that Eric jumped off the balcony whilst his parents were distracted. This is corroborated by witness testimonies and Eric’s shoe prints on the balcony ledge. However, his parents complain that Eric knew better then that. He wasn’t a naughty boy and this seemed entirely out of character for him. Despite being a fan of superman, Eric was old enough at ten years to know he couldn’t fly. Rumour spreads of a murderer lurking at the shopping mall and Eric’s parents rally support for police to review the case. As a result, police reluctantly decide to reopen the investigation. Fortunately for them, they uncover some new evidence. Previously, the mall security had denied the mall having CCTV from the date. However, only a few days after Eric’s death, the mall surveillance officer had quit his job on short notice without alerting officials. The footage from the time is handed over to authorities. The police take the details of the former surveillance officer with plans of pressing charges for withholding information. Or maybe even worse, you can’t rule anyone out from being a suspect in this line of work. But their is confidence the confiscated footage will reveal all. As they play the film, they notice a man standing alongside Eric close to the balcony edge. They pause the film. The police exchange victorious glances. This is the big break they’ve been looking for. They finally have a suspect. He doesn’t match the security guard’s description. As a result, the police continue to play the clip. They watch the stranger help Eric climb on the balcony ledge before they both jump off. Eric falls like a deadweight. But the stranger ,the stranger floats through the sky like a paper aeroplane. People start to scream and gather around Eric’s lifeless body in horror. The man starts to swim above the shopping mall, performing cartwheels in the sky, waving at the people below. However , everyone at the mall ignore his antics, solely focusing on Eric’s collapsed body . As if he is invisible. At one one point he even stares directly at the camera, salutes mockingly before disappearing. The disturbing clip is played back countless of times and reviewed to ensure evidence wasn’t tampered with. After the video is expertly reviewed, it is concluded their was no tampering.

            "⚠ Translation error: Here is my review for Got You by Erik Therme I thoroughly enjoyed reading this suspense thriller that was full of tension and verging on being psychological, as well. Leah had been brought up as an only child by her parents when one night, her dad confessed to Leah and her mum that he’d had an affair. Also, he had another daughter, called Amanda. Leah and Amanda didn’t see eye to eye plus it ruined Leah’s relationship with her dad. She rescued Amanda when she rang for help though. Even the night she died, although she didn’t make any sense and was talking about a son which Leah knew she didn’t have. She hadn’t even heard from her in six months. That’s when strange things started to happen to Leah. She had strange phone hang ups. Couldn’t get hold of her dad to tell him about Amanda. Then there was the strange bouquet of flowers and gift left outside the flat by someone. The doll was seriously creepy. Did someone blame her for Amanda’s death? Did they want her dead? This story was brilliantly written from the start and had me hooked so I couldn’t put it down. I had to carry on reading during the night as I needed to know what happened next as I couldn’t wait a few hours! The plotting was excellently done and it was certainly well thought. The characters were well thought out, intriguing and seemed very realistic when they were well described and their traits were listed. The descriptive writing was excellent and everything was described perfectly. The synopsis drew me to read this story and I most certainly wasn’t disappointed by the full story. It was my type of story which I enjoy reading. I haven’t read this author before but I would like to read more of his books in the future. Blurb : Sisterhood can be fatal. Leah has never been close to her younger half-sister, but she’s not surprised to get a frantic phone call late at night, asking for a ride. Amanda’s life has always been a snarled mess of bad choices and boyfriends, and it’s common for her to resurface mid-crisis. But this time is different. Amanda is adamant about getting to the neighboring town of Belmont but won’t say why—only that her five-year-old son is in danger. But Amanda doesn’t have any kids. Before Leah can get answers, Amanda runs into the road and is killed by a passing car. In the days that follow, Leah convinces herself that Amanda was confused that night, especially after the coroner finds hallucinogenic drugs in her bloodstream. But that doesn’t explain the nameless boy at Amanda’s visitation. Or the middle of the night phone calls with no one on the other end. Or the unshakable feeling of being watched. Someone blames Leah for Amanda’s death. And that someone wants Leah dead. Leah slowed her step as she approached her apartment. Two things had been laid at her door. The first was a bouquet of flowers in cellophane paper—the cheap kind you’d grab from a gas station or grocery store. The second was a red gift bag. No card; only white tissue paper poking out from the top. She bent for a closer look and found a slip of paper taped to the bouquet. SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS was handwritten in neat capital letters. They had to be from Neil. She shot a glance down the hallway, half expecting him to materialize. He’d already shared his condolences twice, so why leave a gift with the flowers? Sorry your half-sister died; here’s a box of chocolates to ease the pain? Leah didn’t want to believe he’d resort to using Amanda’s death as a way back into her life, but she didn’t really know his character. A few dinner dates wasn’t enough time to know anyone. Against her better judgment, she spread apart the tissue paper and looked into the bag. It was a cloth doll, maybe eight inches in length, bent in half at the waist. Leah lifted it out and dropped it with a gasp. Someone had drawn two black X’s across the doll’s eyes. Even worse, a single word had been written in the corner of the doll's mouth.

            "⚠ Translation error: This is such a dark, dark book even for the horror genre. The name, of course, gives that away but it is deeply unsettling and disturbing on all kinds of levels. As a horror aficionado who has built up a kind of tolerance for the macabre, the fact that this book made me feel so unsettled and shook can only be praised! This book does an excellent job of portraying the forays of a down-on-his-luck author looking to get his life, and career, back on track by writing a new bestselling book. To do this, he settles on horror as his genre of choice and decides to begin some research about a place referred to as \"Suicide Town,\" which is known for its disturbing number of suicides; many seemingly inexplicable. Being the dedicated writer he is, he decides to pay the town a visit to get some real inspiration for his story and that's where things really get spicy! This book also does a good job of portraying the dark, oppressive atmosphere surrounding the town as well as the behavior and suspicion that an outsider to such a place is likely to face from the locals. The writer really instills moments of dread and fear, particularly during the later scenes and his trip through the woods. I felt every one of those steps, and his imagination in some parts taking over. The reveal right at the very end was also divine and left the events of what happened very much open to interpretation. Sometimes I get frustrated by a book that doesn't fully reveal everything, but the way it was done here was perfect. There were a few minor typo/editing issues with the book and the character of Iris I found to be somewhat annoying and a little unnecessary who sometimes took the edge off of the horror elements and made a little bit too light of a situation. There were definitely times when it was hard to believe a character could be talking so jovially or about such trivialities given the weight of the situation, and I felt the book could have done without a \"comic relief\" character at all but overall these are minor complaints about an otherwise exceptionally told story. It's also a little bit slow at the beginning, but the methodical setup has its charm and the payoff is well worth it. For any fans of the horror genre, Creepypasta and /r/nosleep this one's definitely for you! --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: That’s How They Get You is not a book you read so much as a world you step into, one essay at a time, a curated carnival of wit, absurdity, observation, and relentless intelligence. Damon Young, as editor and occasional participant, sets the stage with the clarity of someone who knows both the weight of Black life and the levity of Black humor. From the first chapter, you’re introduced to the paradox of laughter and grief, of wit and survival, in Hanif Abdurraqib’s reflection on the dozens. It is a lesson in how humor can carry the dead weight of memory and loss, how a verbal sparring match in the schoolyard can serve as both armor and lifeline. There is tenderness here, yes, but there is also skill—an acknowledgment that humor is not accidental; it is cultivated, strategic, necessary. As you turn the page, you encounter the kaleidoscope of approaches and voices. Jill Louise Busby’s “The Couple” situates us in the pixelated intimacy of social media, a space that is simultaneously communal and isolating. Through the lens of Instagram, we learn how proximity can be manufactured and closeness negotiated from afar, with humor as the adhesive binding digital observation to lived experience. Mateo Askaripour’s chapters on Karens push us into absurdist dystopia, a world where entitlement meets legislative fantasy. The laughter is sharp-edged, almost theatrical in its exaggeration, yet beneath the satire lies a recognition of power, privilege, and the absurdities that stem from both. Damon Young’s own essays, particularly “You Gonna Get These Teeth” and “Email From the Future”, are masterclasses in blending the deeply personal with cultural observation. In the former, Young turns something as mundane and intimate as dental anxiety into a meditation on shame, masculinity, and performance. The phrase “YOU GONNA GET THESE TEETH” resonates as both defiance and affirmation, a rallying cry that transforms vulnerability into comedic empowerment. In the latter, the future becomes a canvas for humor to collide with imagination, offering absurdity and critique in equal measure, reminding us that Black humor is capable of spanning time, form, and expectation simultaneously. Kiese Laymon’s contributions, especially “How to Shit in West Virginia at Night: But for ******?” and “Letters From Home”, embody the anthology’s oscillation between dark humor and profound reflection. Laymon confronts the realities of racial vulnerability in spaces that are ostensibly ordinary, reframing anxiety as absurdity, tension as comedy, survival as narrative. In “Letters From Home”, the collection closes with warmth, nostalgia, and the layered complexities of family and memory. Humor is ever-present, but it is tempered by recognition—an acknowledgment that laughter does not erase risk, history, or pain; it mediates them. Other contributors extend this terrain further. Mahogany L. Browne’s declaration that “You Ain’t Killing That Shit Until a Black Woman Say So” captures authority, cultural literacy, and social negotiation with blunt comedic force. Nicola Yoon reflects on representation in ways that are playful yet piercing, examining the absurdity of scarcity in childhood imagination while celebrating resourcefulness and identity. Wyatt Cenac situates philosophy around the kitchen table, finding comedy in domestic discourse, while Roy Wood Jr. negotiates fatherhood, societal expectation, and racial perception with a mix of charm and pointed observation. Alexander Hardy, Clover Hope, and Brian Broome demonstrate that humor is elastic: it stretches across family kitchens, diner booths, musical landscapes, and intimate personal anxieties. Hardy’s darkly comedic engagement with vulnerability in “Unmurdered in Grandma’s Kitchen” juxtaposes tenderness and absurdity. Hope’s musical musings in “Dancing in the Dark” are playful, rhythmic, and culturally reverent, illustrating how Black humor is intertwined with cultural literacy and artistic interpretation. Broome’s “Tenderheaded” reminds us that identity, pride, and cultural inheritance can be navigated through humor, and that something as everyday as hair carries with it both care and social consequence. The anthology also interrogates the social, political, and systemic with satirical dexterity. Askaripour and Scott exaggerate social hierarchies and collective anxieties, turning moral panic into theater, entitlement into absurdity.

            "⚠ Translation error: Mostly hits and a few misses, pretty good for an anthology. I've read and liked about 30% of the authors here. They delivered. Many of the rest will either be added to my to-read list or moved up in priority. Every piece in here is very short, none longer than 15-20 minutes, and a couple are just a few minutes long. I listened to the audiobook, and would listen to one or two most days. I think that's the way to do it so the laughs can be stretched out over more days. I often found myself wanting to ponder over a piece before moving on anyway. I made the other people in this house listen to more than a few of them. I am a middle aged white lady American, and my favorite piece was Mateo Askaripour's \"The Karens Rights Act\", for whatever that is worth, followed closely by an actual group text about American Presidents who have black sounding names. Clearly, I should have read Askaripour's debut book when Colson Whitehead said so. Alexander Hardy's piece about his grandmother and cooking hit home and made me miss the grandma who couldn't even let us make a bowl of cereal in her kitchen without making sure we were doing it right. Not being able to get Grandma to give you the recipes for her master creations because there aren't any? Begging for years for her to just show you because she just doesn't have the patience or time to be fooling with you because she has a lot of people to feed? And then finally wearing her down, laughing about her secret tricks to perfection (his grandma ate the ugly ones herself; my grandma used a drop of yellow food coloring) and mastering them yourself? I think lots of us can relate to that one especially, and even more so for those of us whose grandmas are gone. Brian Broome being Brian Broome. Damon Young showing me once again what is was like to be a young black man at the same time and in the same place (literally, the same neighborhoods) I was being a young white woman. Stories involving painful things many of us experience, like miscarriage and loving a flawed parent, and many of us don't, like racism and poverty, that don't sound like they can be funny, but some can find humor in the hardest of things, offer new perspectives, and that can help others.

            "⚠ Translation error: They get better as you go. In the end I liked 9 of these stories well enough. There is much repetition - several me-too stories, several quirky elders, several bullies, several street urchins in faraway places. My favorites were The Nanny and Kennedy. Intro: Get this- they're all great stories and it was hard to choose! Godmother Tea: \"I'd pass by the mirror and see fragments of other women.\" On and on. I gave it 5 pages. The Apartment: I loved World's End but hit or miss overall with Boyle. Writing is fine but this story didn't really go anywhere. A Faithful but Melancholy Account: quirky family reunion. \"Stop shouting,\" she said. \"I'm sitting right next to you.\"(I also sometimes lost control of \"my volume,\" as Melissa put it.)\" Sibling Rivalry: robot kids taking over school and people share intimate thoughts in a feed. Pretty thin. Writing lapses into rambling run-on too long to quote here. The Nanny: I really loved The Girls and appreciate Cline for providing the first standout story in this collection. The Nanny manages to breathe new life into not just the old fallen woman trope but also into the sort of stories Jacqueline Susann used to specialize in. I really enjoyed the writing and the story's arc. This would be enjoyable even without the 'scandal' hook- but I loved this character trying to look nice for security cameras. Halloween: crush at retail job with quirky grandmother, no thanks. Something Street: if anyone asked for a fictional glimpse inside the mind of a character based on Camille Cosby, here it is. This is Pleasure: yet another story inspired by the me-too movement. This started out okay but I bailed about halfway in. In the Event: I liked this one, it was an interesting take on how commonplace disasters have become in our lives. The Children: right at the beginning this one promises an adventure but there was no adventure. It made my eyes glaze over. Pretty short but here is an example of something literary writers can learn from genre writers, (please add quotation marks around those): you don't build a world with streams of proper nouns, names of all these people and places. It's like listening to someone talk about where they went and who they met on their vacation. Rubberdust: okay story of bullies and their lessons in grade school. It kept me reading and took me somewhere, so it's a standout for this collection. It's Not You: started out great with some actual humor and enthusiasm, things sorely lacking from everything I've seen so far. \"I built my drunkenness like a fire, patiently\" is a fantastic line. I could quote more. This one was pretty good. Liberté: the writer thinks we are not comprehending the story, so keeps explaining as we go along: \"It's an important discovery, she thinks, a profound one: that someone can detest what he desires or desire what he detests. Which comes first, the wanting or the loathing, she doesn't know.\" Howl Palace: by my count this is the third quirky comic elder in the collection so far, and I am not event counting the Bill Cosby character in that other story. But this story was entertaining and literally made me LOL. So thank you Howl Palace. The Nine Tailed Fox Explains: this one is for the \"magical\" fans I guess. A demon disguised as a mail order bride gives the husband (who ordered her online) the gift of true love ... I am not even kidding. The Hands of Dirty Children: Here's an engaging, well written short story! It's about street kids eating garbage! Octopus VII: Here's another one where the story lets a character explain things for anyone who is not following ... it's not hard to follow. Enlightenment: It's a real pleasure to read this one and to turn it over and over. Have you ever found yourself in an accidental relationship? Kennedy: more unwanted attention, this time from a sadistic bully(?) in art class. There's a great suspense and many nervous laughs as we try to figure out what Kennedy wants from his new best friends. Great story. The Special World: a new freshman heads off to dorm life and falls into a new religion and a new relationship. Very engaging! --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: orical legacy with contemporary experience, emphasizing how humor can be a guide for survival, a ledger of observation, and a mechanism for community-building. These pieces, alongside Laymon’s playful but pointed guidance on navigating public spaces, reflect the anthology’s acute awareness of humor’s social function—it is never purely entertainment; it is reflection, instruction, critique, and communion. Across these 24 essays, a throughline emerges: Black humor is both intensely personal and inherently communal. It is a mechanism for survival, a tool for critique, and a vehicle for connection. The anthology demonstrates that humor can simultaneously entertain, educate, and interrogate. Contributors leverage absurdity, exaggeration, observational acuity, and narrative innovation to explore grief, identity, societal expectation, and cultural authority. The prose is inventive, playful, and often self-aware, capturing the rhythm of speech, the cadence of thought, and the dynamics of culture with fidelity. That’s How They Get You is not without its unevenness. Some essays land with more immediacy than others; some humor resonates more deeply depending on personal experience and cultural literacy. But even within those moments, there is value—the anthology’s willingness to experiment, to take risks with form, voice, and perspective, demonstrates a courage that mirrors its thematic concerns. Humor, after all, is a negotiation; not every joke lands universally, but every attempt speaks to observation, critique, and identity. In sum, Damon Young has curated a collection that is vibrant, reflective, and wide-ranging. The anthology honors the breadth of Black American humor—from intimate self-reflection to absurdist dystopia, from social critique to musical observation, from family kitchens to public bathrooms. It is a celebration of wit, insight, and lived experience, an acknowledgment that humor can be instructive, transformative, and revelatory. Every contributor engages with the complexity of Black life in America, wielding humor as both shield and lens, as solace and weapon, as commentary and connective tissue. The anthology leaves readers laughing, reflecting, and recognizing the intelligence, nuance, and resilience embedded in each essay.

Avevamo visto come la vicinanza forzata a casa di Trapper abbia portato la coppia ad avvicinarsi molto e a passare la notte insieme ma entrambi non vogliono cedere e preferiscono lasciare le cose solo a livello fisico. Crystal deve prima capire che è arrivato il momento di andare avanti e che il marito non avrebbe mai voluto che lei si bloccasse così. Anche Garth deve fare un bel lavoro su stesso perchè la botta che gli ha dato l'ex moglie è stata pesante. Insieme sono molto carini però l'autrice ha messo un po' troppo drama. Troppi incidenti a tutti e due, li ho trovati un po' inutili. Anche meno grazie. Continuerò la serie per scoprire la storia del veterinario. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: What a delight to return to Emerson Pass to continue on where the story left off in Book 2. Tess Thompson’s newest novel, ‘The Patron of Emerson Pass’, doesn’t skip a beat. The characters’ lives in this book are creatively intertwined and comingled with the memories of those that we have read about in her historical romance books of Emerson Pass through newly discovered letters and recipes. Friends and family are connected in more ways than imagined and new memories are created. Love, forgiveness, and healing is what this book focuses on. Is it possible for the characters in this novel to get past betrayal, heartache, mistakes, and lost love? Will they be able to overcome their haunting diminished self-confidences and doubts? Are they destined for life-long loneliness or can they ever be as happy as their friends? This book captivated me from the moment I began reading it. I highly recommend that you read the previous books in this series so that you are familiar with references made by the characters and to familiarize yourself with Emerson Pass, but know that if you just want to jump right in with this book first, you will not be lost and will thoroughly fall in love with all the characters in this novel as I did. You will not be disappointed! Thank you to the author and publisher for the opportunity to read an ARC. All opinions and thoughts are my own and freely given. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

She glowed. And right in front of my eyes her body began to change. Within one hour, it looked to me as if she lost ten pounds. It was as if her body, acquiescing to her will, began to shrink and draw in on itself.` `The noble Goethe had a beautiful line: \"all things ripe want to die.\"` and it was this that boiled over in the form of tears. i held my son isaak as he passed. and this was the case, truly, of my experience with him. his lasts breaths were smile full. he was lit up knowing he was ok. knowing his time was granted and safely said good bye because he was surrounded by love. and his goodbye was not a forever departure, but that of time simply in between. i was scared, i was angry, and sad like you could never imagine. but it`s these moments that its reality becomes more and more clear. more ok to bare. more ok to live fully, and yes, without him. this life has been a curioous one. for sure. i send love to him. through this, through me. forever... and ever. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: It is right there in the title, you know it is coming, Treya's death. You are pretty sure you will be ready for it, but it hits you like a typhoon, and you can not even stand for a long while after you read it. You know if it was a real typhoon, you would have drowned. SO yeah, this is an intense book, a very meaningful, intense book. And before I sing it's praises, I must say I recommend this to anyone with a chronic illness or those caring for someone who has one. If this describes you: MAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. And if you are at all curious about confronting the fears you might have towards death: READ THIS BOOK. In one of the late chapters of this, they (even though this is credited to just Ken Wilber, it is written by both he and his late wife Treya, and at times it is hard to tell whose voice is speaking) relate to meditation as practicing for death. I can not argue that in the slightest. And this whole book is both a love story between two people who obviously love each other more than the characters do in all the romantic comedies you have ever read/seen combined, but it is also practicing for dying. And this is really something to read. Something you clearly do not see much, if any, of in other books. Imagine 10 days after marring the man of your dreams, starting chemo for the breast cancer they discovered. This is Treya's story. Rather than sunning herself in Hawaii she has her breast removed and begins a rigorous round of chemo. That seems a pretty remarkable story in and of itself, but she uses \"cancer as a prompt to 'change those things in your life that need changing.'\" And this is where the real story of healing and growth comes from. As you can tell from the title, here healing is not the same as being cured. She never fully expels the cancer from her body, and it finally consumes her, but... she makes it extremely clear that cancer did incredible things for her, helped her grow and become a more fully realized person. A complete person. And for anyone that may say her healing was incomplete, she confronts that very well: \"I sometimes feel that those around me will judge my success or failure depending on how long I live, rather than on how I live. Of course I want to live a long time, but if it's short, I don't want to be judged a failure.\" And she certainly was not a failure, in her five year battle she begins to practice something she calls passionate equanimity: \"to be fully passionate about all aspects of life, about one's relationship with spirit, to care to the depths of one's being but with no trace of clinging or holding, that's what the phrase has come to mean to me. It feels full, rounded, complete, and challenging.\" And while you read about her embracing the joy all around her, even as tumors are causing her to go blind and when she can no longer walk up the stairs or even stand, you know there is something remarkable about this healing. It may not have been perfect for her body, but it sure was for her mental and emotional health. As I said before, this was an incredibly hard book to get though. The passages about the chemo forced me to walk away quite a few times. But by the end of the book, while I was sobbing at the pitch of a flash flood, I was far more able to read and be present with her death, as I took away some lessons about passionate equanimity from her. It is a horribly sad story, but she and Ken embrace it with such joy, even the darkest hours. I would love to be doing this better, and I think I may be just a bit too close to this illness to, so just read it instead. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: I'm reading this book for class. It's not my favorite book. I want to like it, for I think it should have something somewhat profound to say about death, dying and the \"mystical\" experience. But Wilber comes off as being highly impressed by his own ideas... and, from my perspective at least, he seems to misunderstand some of the teachings he's trying to interpret. Or, at least, he picks and chooses the interpretations he likes and manipulates other info so that it fits into his own ideas. Basically, I personally find the beauty of the descriptions of mystical experiences to be most intense when they're least pretentious. Hence my fascination with Chinese Taoism, Cha'an and Japanese Zen. Highly unpretentious practices/philosophies. Ken and Treya on the hand are highly pretentious. And for a couple of people who are determined to see past the ego, they sure seem to enjoy basking in their own. Everything is \"I\", \"I\", \"I\" and \"me\", \"me\", \"me\". I also find it somewhat humorous that Ken never seems to pass up an opportunity to include a statement from someone calling things like a \"genius\" or a \"man of astounding intellectual breadth\", yada, yada, yada, etc. What I do like about the book is that the love story between Ken and Treya at times is highly touching. Also, the story of Treya's bout with cancer is also touching and heart breaking. In short, the actual narrative is fairly engaging. It's all the half-baked new-age philosophizing that rubs me the wrong way. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: I read this book not because of story of Treya and her fight with cancer, but to get to know Ken Wilber work a little bit, because I heard that in this book he mentions something about his work and ideas. I have mixed feelings. As a person who is very scientific and oppose any \"mysticism\" and other mumbo-jumbo, I have to say that 1) I was suprised (in a good way), that Wilber differentiates mumbo-jumbo from maybe-not-mumbo-jumbo. For example his definition of esoteric and exoteric religions. That's a big \"nice\" from my side. But at the same time: 2) I am displeased by his free use of word \"scientific\". No, what you're doing is not scientific only because it's a \"direct experience\". You have to give in to the scientific method, and this you're not doing. Science is not only about direct experience, but also a few more things. Kids hitting each other with a stick and observing how they break are not scientific, while they have direct experience. I like the idea of letting go of an ego, to grow to a \"higher levels\". But at the same time I think that Ken and people like him do not take into account that what they believe to be an enlightement might as well be just an illusion created by a mind, or neurochemical disorders in brain or things like depersonalization/derealization. In fact there is a research about mindfulness causing depersonalisation/derealization - healthy people experience it as something wrong and not nice feeling, while people who are seeking \"enlightement\" interpret those things as enlightement. Forgive me for being blunt, but it's like if someone would believe that having a diarrhea is \"my body cleansing itself! finally!\". Just please be a little bit critical and try to think that maybe, just maybe, what you call an enlightement and magical higher truth, reaching the level of Seer/Witness et cetera is not some great goal that everyone should achieve. Perhaps it's just reducing your self to nothingness, because there might be nothing behind both self and Self. I am not saying that it's true, but a true scientist would take it into account, while Wilber seems to not considering it at all. It's only one reason why he is not a scientist while he calls himself one. Not to mention that I felt that he is using Treya story to promote his own person and agenda. In a book about partner dying of cancer, and supposedly about her and his way through that hard time, he manages to include pages of his interviews and excerpts from his books - what for? I mean, I like those parts, but why they are put in this book? He seems to have tendencies to exaggerate things a little bit also. For example when he said that Treya was fearless, and some pages later Treya herself is writing in a diary, that she was scared, sobbing et cetera. No, she was not fearless. And I think that her story with cancer is actually quite normal for people fighting with cancer. Nothing extraordinary. Fear, deny, trying to grasp to life, to show middle finger to the illness by living the life, and then dying - because she was exhausted, not because she was as Wilber put it \"ripe\", when he supposedly quotes Goethe \"All ripe things want to die\" (I can't google where Goethe said that). When he wrote that she died with open mouths and then when he came back to the room, mouth was closed and smile appeared on her face, and according to him it could not be a \"rigor mortis smile\", then I rolled my eyes. Yes, the ultimate enlightement that she reached made her body smile after she died. Not rigor mortis. For sure. Sorry for being such a negative person. Overall it was interesting book that expanded my knowledge about ideas of enlightement and what some people believe! What meditation can lead to et cetera. But some parts I couldn't help but criticize. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: A nice little guide. Nothing fantastic, but probably worth reading if you're me or similar. I read this back when it came out eight or so years ago and some of the rules have stuck with me pretty strongly (e-mail versus email, parallel structure, a few others). Sure, Walsh is curmudgeonly as he'd be the first to admit (in one or two places he's downright and oddly mean), but it's mostly pretty good advice. While he admits that any style guide is merely a snapshot of the current state of affairs, there's already some anachronistic stuff when it comes to the web, or as he'd call it, the Web, which I'm sure even he's not doing anymore. At a certain point I wondered who this book was for, and what was its point—a \"real\" writer (or I suppose a real editor), I thought, would just pick a styleguide (AP, Chicago, NYT(?)) and get that, use it as a reference—what was the point of these half-way guides? They're not exhaustive enough to serve as a full reference guide, but they're too nitty-gritty nuts-and-bolts to serve as a fun read. But both of these notions are pretty much false. This is a guide for someone who's interested in improving their (as Walsh would say) grammar/etc., not a professional editor. He keeps it entertaining and it's a quick read with a good deal of information in a small space. (You can read the whole thing in a couple sittings.) I flagged a couple spots for going-back-to-later. Anyway, the design is a hot mess, but what can you do there. Worth the time, I'd say. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

Liking the chat, I went and bought his best reviewed book, The Elephants of Style. The allusion to the Strunk and White classic is deliberate and indicative of his irreverent style. Unfortunately, when all is said and done, it's still a book about nitpicky grammar debates. Walsh leans towards the descriptivist camp rather than prescriptionist (neither word which passes muster with spell-check) which is the way I lean as well. On most topics, he lays out what the dispute is, what the various sides assert and then gives the side he comes down on.His advice is always sound and logical but it's still arbitrary.

            "⚠ Translation error: tantly wanted to reread this and try to understand all the parts I’d missed. Denis Johnson, The Largesse of the Sea Maiden - ★★★☆☆ A fascinating story in different movements about… boredom, or ennui, but that would be a reduction. I particularly loved “Silences” and “Widow”; the author has a great way of conveying the ways in which people talk to each other. Yet parts of this felt irrelevant or drawn out. [Also, the section about mentally handicapped people in “Adman” was really quite offensive.] Joy Williams, The Country - ★★★☆☆ A story about a father son and an odd group called Come and See. I really don't know what to make of this, but the writing was decidedly compelling. Christine Schutt, A Happy Rural Seat... - ★★★★☆ I couldn't quite explain to you why I found this story, about a couple named Nick and Pie and an event that changes them forever, so interesting, but I certainly did. Schutt has a fascinating writing style that I loved digging my teeth into. Don Dello, Hammer and Sickle - ★★☆☆☆ A story about a man in prison and debts in Dubai. It was at this point that I began to realize many of these contemporary fiction short stories were getting a bit repetitive. Matthias Svalina, Play - ★★★★☆ Reframing life as a game played by children. People are dehumanized and referred to as it in each game. Rather than having a plot, it serves as an itemized list. This one is very cool. Lucy Corin, Madmen - ★★★★★ Really amazing story about a world wherein people adopt a mad person. I find both the premise and the writing of this fascinating. Mary Gaitskill, The Arms and Legs of the Lake - ★★☆☆☆ Follows an array of narrators talking about their experiences with the Iraq war. A lot of interesting stuff in here. I found the racial politics of this questionable; the use of the N word was really deeply not needed and functioned almost entirely for shock value. Wells Tower, Raw Water - ★☆☆☆☆ Hate that I'm one starring this because this man really can write. Wonderful descriptions, really generally well-written, fantastic concept, and I adore environmental horror. However, the comical degree to which the author of this story others women turned me off. From the beginning I was laughing a bit; “she was a pretty woman but close to sixty” was such a classic that it really made me chuckle. But the sexual assault by a grown man of a sixteen-year-old girl, complete with heavy sexualization of her, incestual subtext, and an array of imagery around her fertility as opposed to the 43-year-old oldster our protagonist calls his wife, was far too much. This was really upsetting, but not in the eerie way I'd hoped from earlier bits of the story; in a way that left me with an awful taste in my mouth that I don't see dispelling anytime soon. Oh, and I wonder if Wells Tower was aware when he wrote about Cora, who is 43, having just finished menopause, a detail he adds as a literary indicator of her infertility, that menopause is typically a several-year period that starts between the ages of 45 and 55. Not worth a star rating; just wondered if he knew about that part. Rachel B. Glaser, Pee on Water - ★★☆☆☆ No explanation, no definition, you just have to accept it. My short fiction professor compared this story to an epic in that it uses empirical evidence, or an establishment that these things happened, and is not big on narrative tension; it tells you what it will be giving. Themes of cleanliness are prominent. Interesting story to analyze, but really not fun to read in my humble opinion. Tao Lin, Love Is a Thing On Sale... - ★★☆☆☆ I found this story... frankly rather myopic in its cynicism. There's a degree to which many of the stories in this novel connect cynicism about society to a cynicism about human nature and love, and I think it's a connection I disagree with. Rebecca Curtis, The Toast - ★★★★☆ Follows a woman writing a literal toast for her sister’s wedding. This was SO compelling on a sheer writing and character level. Robert Coover, Going for a Beer - ★★☆☆☆ Interesting few-page-long story. I also love misogyny. Charles Yu, Standard Loneliness Package - ★★★★★ Instantly one of my favorite short stories of all time, following an unnamed narrator who lives the grief of others for a living as he falls for a woman named Kirthi. A literalization of emotional labor and capitalist critique, but also a gorgeous single story. When dipping too close to his emotional state, the narrator steps back, returning to a place of narrating events and emot --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: Breaking my own rules to give this four stars... There are problems with this book. First, the typos. I get independent publishing. And, I'm usually forgiving on the first two or three. But, past that, I become unforgiving. Second, the prose was fat. It needed a tough editor. It needed someone to read the chapters and say \"hey, you're wasting space here, tighten this up by 20% or 30%.\" The text needed that. If I was grading this as a paper, I'd say: good ideas, re-write for clarity and brevity. So, by rights, that's two stars. That said, I really like Brittney Hartley. Her story is compelling. Her ideas, and the way she'd putting them together, are something we need (or, I need). She's an atheist who is past the stage of name-calling, ridiculing tirades. That's to say that, intellectually and morally, she's ten miles ahead of Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins. So, I really feel like she is a voice that needs to be heard. I hope she's still talking about this stuff when my kids need to hear it. At the moment, though, Brittney's YouTube channel is the better source for her ideas. They are collected here, but, the presentation needs refining. This book is cool because the outline is cool, the set of topics is cool, the questions at the end of the chapters are cool. But, the prose of the chapters themselves is a slog. Write another book, Britt. Take these ideas and take 'em a step further. Keep sharpening the stone. You're young.

            "⚠ Translation error: I’ve been a longtime follower of Brittney Hartley, and would even refer to her as a sort of mentor, one sided as it may be. This book is clearly written for a niche group, those of us deconstructing Christianity who have landed in atheism and/or nihilism, but are open to secular spirituality for mental well-being. There are not nearly enough female voices in this philosophical space. I found the book insightful, but no more insightful than her online discussions—the book felt like a condensed version of her many online talks. There is a lot of focus on creating a meaningful life and having a sense of purpose. While I understand the value in that, I wish she’d also talked more the validity of just being—that we don’t require a purpose and can just exist. Perhaps that’s where hedonism can take off though. Regardless, I think where Brit Hartley ended up is a sort of ethical hedonism in her train of thought on living for experience while also being conscious of how our beliefs, words, and actions affect the collective. Overall, it’s a great book with a lot of helpful suggestions. It’s the kind of book you’ll want to sit down with when you have some time alone with a highlighter and a pen. Britt Hartley weaves a practical balance between atheism and spirituality, blending the best of both worlds. I can understand some of the criticism for this book—mainly that it needed more editing. You can tell it came from a personal place, which was a bit unexpected considering she’s an academic, but that’s not a bad thing. Overall it was a heartfelt, if niche, take on spirituality. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: I really enjoyed Maggie Lehrman's debut The Cost of All Things and was eager to see what she'd do next. The Last Best Story is a bit of a conundrum. It's kind of a crazy caper, and I absolutely loved that part of it. We have Rosie and Grant, serious about the newspaper (well, that is until Rosie quit), and when things go slantwise at the prom, their investigative instincts kick in. They have to get to the bottom of it all. Even Rosie, who has sworn off the paper and Grant. I also really loved the relationship between Rosie and Grant and how it's all a jumble right now. It was fun to see it work itself out. The thing I'm not that sure about in this story is that the reason the prom goes on lockdown is because someone has a gun in the building. This is (obviously) a serious concern these days. Maggie Lehrman treads this fine line between comedy and tragedy, and I'm not sure it was entirely satisfying. Still, I enjoyed this book, even if the treatment of gun violence made me a little uncomfortable, and I'll definitely read Maggie's next book.

            "⚠ Translation error: DC Mallery’s “Sara Sarque & the Demon Executioner and Other Stories of Mystery, Terror, Heartbreak, Hope and Humor” is one of, if not the best short story collection I’ve ever read. While the author’s book sits firmly in the horror genre, the range of these stories varies from mild to downright terrifying. A dozen wildly different stories make up this short story compilation. Each rips readers into a different mindset. Starting with a preface, Mallery tantalizes the reader with the whiplash that is about to occur, briefly introducing us to each story housed within, before sending us out into the stormy waves. From “The Trauma Eater” about a man suffering nightmare deaths of different families he’s never had, to “Temples of Fire” about a recently divorced woman determined to travel the world, these tales are eerie, thought-provoking, and disturbing in a manner I never could have imagined. I found that whether the story was a short few pages or the headlining story of one hundred pages, each drew me in with such force I was fully engulfed in the world Mallery created. The sheer talent and depth of each of these fully formed tales was impressively overwhelming, I never imagined writing could sweep me off my feet in the way this collection did. From the late 1700s to seedy bars, high-speed chases, abandoned buildings, or international caves, each is guaranteed to elicit guttural feelings within as you wait to be snapped by the conclusion. While I typically steer far away from horror movies, preferring a restful night’s sleep to tossing and turning with nightmares, “Sara Sarque & the Demon Executioner” housed far more terrifying and far more imaginative horror than any movie could ever capture. Whether fully engulfed in “The Woman and The Maze” or engrossed by “Acts of Absolution in the Circus of the Night,” there was no story within that didn’t capture my attention and transport me directly into the pages and characters within. None of these felt “short,” and each enraptured me in ways full novels never have, showing off the immeasurable talent Mallery has with words, characters, and tales. Short stories promise a multitude of plots and storylines within the covers of any paperback housing it. But Mallery’s stories and talent are so otherworldly and unlike anything I’ve ever read. I may never read a full novel, or collection of short stories, as engrossing and enjoyable as this. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: Important volume on one of humanity's greatest religious works In the Upanishads there are two selves. They are symbolized by two birds sitting on a tree branch. The one bird, the self with a small \"s\" eats. The other bird, the Self with a capital \"S\" observes. The first self is the self that is part of this world. The second Self is merely an observer that doesn't take part and is in fact beyond the pairs of opposites such as pleasure and pain that dominate our existence. This Self is formally called the Atman. In an important analogy, it is said that the Atman is the drop of water that glides off of the lotus leaf into the ocean of Brahman, with Brahman being the entirety of all that there is, in other words, God, the God beyond all attribution. This presentation of the Upanishads--necessarily a selection, of course--by Eknath Easwaran is the best single volume that I have come across for the following reasons: First, the translation by Easwaran is readable, edifying and congenial to the Sanskrit in so far as that is possible. The poetry in the original language and the word play are lost in translation as is always the case with poetry and highly symbolic language, and especially language that is meant to be taken on more than one level. However Easwaran's notes after each Upanishad help to give us an idea what the original is like and give the reader a feel for the some of the nuances. Second, the chapter introductions and the concluding essay by Michael N. Nagler lend insight and clarity to the reader's understanding. Third, the selections themselves and what is included in the selections are efficacious. By that I mean the ideas and the \"feel\" of the expression, the psychology, and the philosophy of the Upanishads and the larger Vedic tradition are made manifest. Some voluminous translations give us much more of the repetition and ritual than we need, while some volumes give us perhaps not enough. In this regard I want to call the reader's attention to the slim volume The Ten Principal Upanishads (1937) by the poet W.B. Yeats, and Shree Purohit Swami. Easwaran's book contains more of the Upanishads and offers a more extensive commentary, but Yeats and Purohit are more poetic. I recommend that the reader read both books. Alas Yeats's book is out of print and so you'll have to find it at, probably, a college library. Here is how Easwaran translates the invocation to the famous Isha Upanishad: All this is full. All that is full. From fullness, fullness comes. When fullness is taken from fullness, Fullness still remains. Om shanti shanti, shanti Now here is how Yeats and Purohit have it: This is perfect. That is perfect. Perfect comes from perfect. Take perfect from perfect; the remainder is perfect. May peace and peace and peace be everywhere. I think the former is perhaps truer to the spirit of the philosophy of the Upanishad, but I think the latter is more poetic. The Upanishads, usually acknowledged to be the culmination of the wisdom of the Vedas, form the basis for Hinduism as well as serving as a wellspring for Jainism, Buddhism, Taoism, and yoga. Many ideas central to these ways of life are found in the Upanishads. In particular the Bhagavad Gita finds its inspiration and even some of its expression and even a bit of its form in the most famous and most often read Upanishad, the Katha. Nachiketas of the Katha becomes Arjuna of the Gita, while Death becomes Krishna of the Gita. In his essay, Nagler writes, \"Taken as a whole, the Upanishads contain the raw material of a profound philosophy.\" In the tradition of India, philosophy and religion are not separate as they usually are in the West. In truth all religions contain not only religious ideas, but philosophical ones as well; but more than anything, religions are psychologies--guides on how to live life, and how to die. In the Upanishads we do not die. Death happens only to the bird that eats. Our real essence, the Atman is eternal, and therefore death is an illusion, a compelling illusion to be sure, but one that can be tossed off through an understanding that \"thou art that\" (\"tat tvam asi\") meaning that you and the universe (or Brahman) are one. Nagler writes, \"Indian religious systems hold as a core belief that the individual is not that which dies but is instead the forces which brought the body and personality into existence and will continue shaping its destiny after what we call death…\" (p. 287). --Dennis Littrell, author of “Yoga: Sacred and Profan --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: To Walk a Pagan Path: Practical Spirituality for Every Day is a non-fiction guide book on how to not only walk the Pagan path, but how to incorporate your spiritual beliefs into daily life. I have been a practicing pagan for about ten years now, but even now finding time for religion is still something that I struggle with. I do walk the walk, but it's nowhere near as often or as in depth as I like. To Walk a Pagan Path definitely helped with some great advice on how to solve this problems. One of these steps has all to do with food. This book includes recipes for things like breads and treats to make any day of the week, or especially for a ritual. There's also a section on crafting things that will become vital to most, like candles and wreaths. Plus, Alaric Albertsson gives insight on how to make daily ritual completely feasible in today's busy (and urban) world- you can feel just as connected to your path with a simple ritual as you can with an ornately complicated one. I also found the section written about the Wheel of the Year extremely helpful. I'm always searching for ways to better my sabbats and rituals, and I appreciated gaining insight from this book, since it is not strictly focused on Wicca, but paganism as a whole. The one part of this book that I didn't really connect to was the section regarding familiars and animals. While I respect and understand the importance that having pets and caring for nature has in the pagan world, it wasn't very practical advice for me personally . I live in housing that doesn't allow animals bigger than fish, and I don't have land. I also am not allowed to have multiple kinds of lights used for plants, and I don't have the space to grow them in natural lighting. However, pet people and homeowners will probably find this far more useful. I would be more likely to hand this book to someone who is relatively new or inexperienced to paganism, because it reads fairly simply and is easy to understand. However, I'm sure that even well seasoned practitioners would pick up a pointer or two from To Walk a Pagan Path. I know that I'd keep it on my Magick shelf, for sure.

            "⚠ Translation error: To Walk a Pagan Path I thought this one would a little different. It started off with the introduction of a term called “Hal Sadu” that incorporates the body, mind, and spirit. It taught that it’s not what you *believe*. Rather it’s what you do in actions and deeds. This is the very thing that attracted me to the path I choose. Only I didn’t know it by this name. I am a strong believer in taking action and I immediately was drawn to the dedication ceremony. It also made me want to get better at setting aside a certain time for spirit. Consistency is a big area of my life (in all things) in need to work on. But as the chapters wore on, I started to not connect to any of it. In Chapter Two it talked about the importance of having a Sacral Calendar. As Pagans we have 8 holy days. It suggests that you might want to do something more personal to your spiritual path. Following what he calls the “Neo-Pagan” Calendar is enough for me. A lot of times I feel like I should be celebrating those days alone more than I do (and remembering them). It’s not easy thing to do as a solitary in a Christian household. It really goes into depth on all the ways you can make the calender more personal to your choosen path. In Chapter Three, goes into Daily Devotions. It talks about morning meditation. To some extent I follow this. It might not always be a “prayer” to my personal spirit. It might just be me laying there before I wake up just having a “talk”. The “talk” might just ramble on in all directions until the words in my head just run out. It was a good idea to also spend some time with spirit before you go to sleep and tell what your thankful for in the day and ask for help with any issues. For me if something good that I’m thankful for happens in a day I simply just say a short thank you at the moment it happens. Whether it’s a big something or a small something like I get a day when no yard noise. Or I find a tv show that just pops up in my head. (Remember I’m TERRIBLE at consistency). Then it starts talking about offerings and “house elves” (which is something that I’ve never truly understood). Chapter 4 talked a lot of Familiars Spirits. While I’ve always thought it would be nice to have a black kitten, I know that 1) I’d have to get over my fear all things animal and 2) One day that little adorable kitten would grow up into a big, fat, cat. So for now I have a stuffed black cat and that’s what works for me. It’s just wouldn’t make sense right now for me to own a familiar and particularly some of the ones suggested. A dog? Had a couple. I was never really close to either. Although a random one did save my life. Perhaps it was my familiar and I just didn’t realize it at the time. Plus, as the book points out WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! It goes into WAY TOO MUCH detail about caring for a dog if you don’t have a dog. A cat? It would have to be one that stayed small and the smallest one I could get. Rodents? UH NOOO! I had a VERY bad experience with a girl who lived next door to me in college that had a RAT and the damn thing kept getting a loose in my room. The first time it happened scared the MESS out of me and I just stood in the hallway CONFUSED wondering did I just see a damn rat in my room. She told me not to tell. I told! He might have learned to trust Henry but that chicks rat in the dorm I was NOT trying to bond with. Hamsters and Gerbils? Uhh. I don’t know. Mice? No, I don’t think so. Rabbits? Now my cousin did have a rabbit when he was little. He gave it to his “girlfriend” as a present. It was cute but… A dove or a bird? It worked for Harry Potter. Maybe. A toad? Uh I think I learned from Neville Longbottom they like to escape too much. A turtle? My cousin also had a turtle. Possibly. DEFINITELY NO TO SNAKES! Then Chapter 5 is the typical (Fruits and Vegetables) chapter about what a good idea it is to grow your own food and the history of the ancestors before us who had to do this. My aunt’s community center has recently got into gardening. I have nothing against growing your own vegetables but is it likely I’m going to go out and buy seeds and plant spinach, radishes, and lettuce? Not likely. So, this just wasn’t helpful to me. I’m grateful to the ones that *have* to provide me with food daily but Publix, “The Pig” and Walmart and I have had an arrangement for years. I pay them. They supply me with the foods. It’s a simple arrangement and it works for me. And if it ain’t broke -as the saying goes- don’t fix it. Not only did this --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: This is a good book, but didn't seem to be quite what I thought it was going to be. Easwaran goes through the story of the Katha Upanishad in the first two chapters, with commentary and spiritual interpretation, which is more or less what I expected. Then the following 10 chapters seem to be his own representation of the spiritual path, without much reference back to the source text. His perspective seems to focus on the \"problem\" of the spiritual path -- how we can't be truly happy following our desires and thinking the physical world is our true reality. He briefly describes his meditation practice, but without any formal instruction. The goal of it seems to appear mostly as a contrast to our current state, and as a better way of living in this world, rather than taking us all the way to nirbikalpa samadhi and complete freedom from this world. That said, what he does, he does very well. His writing is fun and engaging, with lots of amusing personifications of mental qualities, etc. At the end of the book is the complete (I assume?) Katha Upanishad, by itself. And admittedly, there's not a lot to the story, so what we got in the first two chapters was basically the plot. The bulk of it is a monologue by Death, rather along the lines of Krishna's teachings in the Bhagavad Gita. I think perhaps most of chapters 3-12 did relate to verses in this section, but if so, I think it would have worked better to follow along more explicitly. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

And somehow you weren't in love with any of the characters. Not a difficult read by any means, but nevertheless, a slow go. If you are a vegetarian or vegan or PETA member, then you might really enjoy this book since it deals with those subjects. You will read a lot about how different animals are killed - so much so that it does make one feel guilty about eating animals and drinking milk.

            "⚠ Translation error: No matter how many Chris Bohjalian books I read, he always seems to have more. Like his most famous book, Midwives, this one concerns a single tragic incident (here the shooting of a father by his own daughter), and then builds a story around the question of intent (did the daughter shoot her father accidentally or did she knowingly pull the trigger?). The question is never definitively answered, but the way each character in the book decides to view the situation affects their interactions with everyone else, and crucial decisions they make about each other and their own futures. Unlike Midwives and some of Bohjalian's other novels (Trans-Sister Radio and Buffalo Soldier, for example), I didn't find this one as compelling. I found the behavior of the daughter - while perhaps realisitc - incredibly annoying as she attempts to hide crucial information about the night of the shooting. The father is also a vegan animal rights activist who is portrayed as a borderline psychotic because of his beliefs - which don't actually seem all that crazy. So much of what threatens to tear the family apart post-shooting seems focused on this group he belongs to. While I appreciate a story that points out the ills of working too hard at the expense of one's home life - I thought the negative treatment of vegetarianism and veganism in the book completely odd. Perhaps this is a result of living in a part of the country where non-meat-eaters are basically mainstream, but I just didn't see it as creating as much conflict in life as this man's choices seemed to. I feel like most of Bohjalian's books could serve as excellent springboards for discussions among high school students about the difference between right and wrong, and all the gray areas in between. This one is definitely no different, but certainly not as complex or riveting as others he has written. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

I recently read The Sirah of the Prophet ﷺ: A Contemporary and Original Analysis by Dr. Yasir Qadhi, and I loved every bit of it. Having read a few books on the Sirah before, I was overjoyed when this book was published, especially since it was authored by one of my favorite scholars and narrators. While reading, however, I realized there were several aspects I had hoped to find but didn’t. I initially thought this book would be very comprehensive, covering every detail of the Prophet Muhammad’s ﷺ life. Yet, I found it to be more of a brief biography rather than the exhaustive account I was yearning for. Perhaps it’s just my personal expectation, but I long for a book that meticulously covers every part of the Prophet’s life—his daily routines, his sayings, his actions, the environments he lived in, the houses in Makkah and Medina, and every detail that could immerse me further into his life. Each time I learn something new about the Prophet ﷺ, it brings me immense happiness. That’s why, when I saw this book, I had high hopes it would provide fresh insights and details I hadn’t encountered before. While the book is beautifully written and engaging, I feel it lacks the depth and detail I was looking for. Additionally, I wish the book included more visual aids—maps, diagrams, and images to bring the narrative to life. Dr. Yasir Qadhi is an incredible scholar with vast knowledge, and I sincerely hope that someday he publishes a comprehensive work about the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ—one filled with detailed accounts, visuals, and every piece of information he can share. Nevertheless, I still deeply appreciated this book because, after all, it’s about our beloved Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. Despite its brevity, it’s a treasure for anyone seeking to connect with his blessed life. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

Divided into the Prophet's two distinct time frames - the Meccan era and the Medinan era - this book carefully, critically, and succinctly illustrates every important aspect in detail - from explaining the context of the Jahiliyyah to the political climate of Arabia during the Prophet's time. Dr Yasir Qadhi elaborates on every vital detail of the Prophet's life - from his childhood to his Prophethood- while also providing insight into his household and relationships with his Companions based on various narrations and hadith. The work is very well-researched with references to numerous sources. The author has maintained a high level of critical examination of his resources. In addition, the book mentions the revelations that the Prophet received, while also detailing the significance of the revelations with the different incidents in the sirah. There are many elaborate and clear explanations of events such as the Battle of Badr, the Conquest of Mecca, and The Greatest Calamity, which was truly a great tug on one's heartstrings. I loved how the book shifts between detailed analysis and compelling storytelling. The narrative echoes a wide knowledge and extensive research into the sirah, as well as comprehensible and comprehensive content that is sure to enlighten and illuminate anyone who wishes to learn about the beauty of Islam, and most definitely, the life of the beloved Prophet. This book flowed beautifully. The narrative style is excellent. It is an essential text for a Muslim household or for anyone who wants to know about the beauty of the life of the Prophet Muhammad S.A.W. from a believer's point of view. I would strongly encourage non-Muslims to read this book to understand Islam better. Perchance Allah S.W.T. mercifully converts him or her. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: I have to highly recommend this book on Sirah, especially for converts who are not yet fluent in Arabic. I just finished Dr. Joel Hayward's \"The Warrior Prophet: Muhammad صَلَّى ٱللَّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ وَسَلَّمَ and War\" earlier this week, and following it up directly with Dr. Qadhi's book has been an extremely enjoyable experience. I intend to finish Mohiuddin's \"Revelation: The Story of Muhammad\" صَلَّى ٱللَّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ وَسَلَّمَ (which is more of textbook rather than narrative breakdown of the Sirah, and very useful in that way) in the next week or two. I have read the classic Martin Lings' \"Muhammad\" صَلَّى ٱللَّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ وَسَلَّمَ at least five times since converting in 1993, and we are reading that and the essential (I would argue the most essential book on Sirah translated into English) Shifaa' of Qadi Iyadh (\"Muhammad, Messenger of Allah صَلَّى ٱللَّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ وَسَلَّمَ : Ash-shifa of Qadi 'Iyad\" translated by Aisha Bewley) as a group in weekly gatherings. There are more and more resources in Sirah. When I was a new Muslim in the '90's, we were happy when \"The Sealed Nectar\" was translated (very poorly) into English (I love the book in many ways, but they needed a native speaker for a translator and a good editor). Now, there is so much more for us to read. This book flowed beautifully. The narrative style is excellent. It is an essential text for a Muslim household or for anyone who wants to know about the beauty of the life of the Prophet Muhammad صَلَّى ٱللَّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ وَسَلَّمَ from a believer's point-of-view. The book had me in tears at many points, in such a good way. It is a poignant reminder of what our Islam should be, for we have in our Prophet the Perfect Exemplar. صَلَّى ٱللَّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ وَسَلَّمَ --> No translation was found using the current translator.

Some of Tibet's most revered incarnate lamas, including His Holiness the Dalai Lama and His Holiness the Gyalwa Karmapa, are considered to be human incarnations of Avaloki­teshvara.” (p. 35) “the apparent duality of subject and object is not given in reality. It is a structure that we, out of fear and ignorance, impose on the world. When we see the phenomenal world truly as it is, we realize a level of being that precedes the subject-object split. This is the true nature of “experience,” “awareness,” or “nondual mind,” understood at this point as interchangeable categories. When Tibetans say that the spirits, gods, and deities are aspects of mind and nothing other than mind, they mean it in this sense, that their fundamental nature— as indeed the nature of all phenomena— is nondual awareness.” (p. 46) “we humans are one part of a vast, interconnected web of relationships with all other inhabitants of the cosmos, both those still living within delusion and those who are awak­ened.” (p. 47) “Our interconnectedness with the rest of the cosmos rests on deep foundations. Most fundamentally, we share with all other beings the inherent core of buddha-nature— the inner, awakened state that dwells at the heart of all sentient beings as their inmost essence. We might consider all beings as having, like us, membership in the same great family— just as we view our children and our parents equally as family members, even though they are at earlier or later stages of life than we are. In a similar way, we are at a certain stage in our spiritual evolution. The others in the vast sea of being are at other stages in the very same process. Insects, for example, represent an earlier phase in this process, fully awakened buddhas a later one. But fundamentally, we are all made of the same stuff, so to speak.” (p. 48) “... the syllables OM MANI PADME HUM , the universally known and revered mantra of Avalokiteshvara, or OM AH HUM VAJRAGURU PADMA SIDDHI HUM , the most important mantra of Padmasambhava. In Vajrayana Buddhism, the mantras embody in sound the essence of particular buddhas, protectors, or departed gurus. In saying them, one is directly and powerfully con­necting with those beings to whom one is making the supplication.” (p. 61) “Tibetan Bud­dhists belong to the tradition known as the Mahayana, or ‘‘greater vehi­cle,” the type of Buddhism that was prevalent until modern times in North and East Asia. The human ideal of the Mahayana is the bodhisattva, the “enlightenment being” who practices wisdom and compas­sion and strives for enlightenment for the welfare of all beings. According to the Mahayana, every human being, and, indeed every sen­tient being, is destined one day to become a fully enlightened buddha, just like Buddha Shakyamuni. Those who came before and already at­tained buddhahood are found, as mentioned, throughout time and space. The path to fully enlightened buddhahood that each of us must fol­low is immeasurably long, involving millions of lifetimes of study, med­itation, and selfless work for others. At an early stage in the path, one takes the bodhisattva vow, the vow to attain full enlightenment for the welfare of others. Subsequently, the bodhisattva progresses through var­ious stages (margas, paths) and levels (bhumis). In his (or her) final life, just like Shakyamuni, the bodhisattva is born into a world system in which the dharma is unknown. There he attains enlightenment and initiates the tradition of dharma. As an enlightened buddha, he is en­dowed with superhuman qualities and powers, and ranks above even the highest gods. The “life” of Buddha Shakyamuni, then, describes the final birth and last life of Gautama (Shakyamuni’s given name), the person destined to become the fully enlightened buddha of our world system. Various Ti­betan hagiographies reflect both the human and the superhuman aspects of the Buddha’s identity. In fact, within the Indian context, these are seen as inseparable: to fully realize one’s human nature is to attain the superhuman pinnacle of existence.” (p. 68) The basic Buddhist teachings, consisting of the four noble truths: “1. The truth of suffering, that the experience of pain, frustration, and incompletion are part and parcel of the human condition; 2.

            "⚠ Translation error: http://bookslifewine.com/r-the-skinny... I was introduced to Gina Homolka and her Skinnytaste Blog by a friend several years ago and I have been following the blog ever since. When The Skinnytaste Cookbook was announced, I was cautiously excited. Sadly, a lot of the food blogs I follow put out cookbooks around the same time so I lost track of this one. Fast forward some time and I'm once again trying to control my diet. I'd started using some of the recipes on the Skinnytaste blog but rarely. Then I decided to borrow a copy from the library and I loved it. The Skinnytaste Cookbook reminds me of the old school cookbooks I used to get years ago: stuffed to the brim with both photos and recipes. And thank goodness Gina Homolka didn't feel the need to cram pages and pages of her preaching at me - she got right to the good stuff. From The Skinnytaste Cookbook : Make Ahead Western Omelet \"Muffins\" - pg 29 These are just ok. I can't rave about them but they are easy to make, to use substitutions with and easy to pack/carry. I made my \"muffins\" with no meat but I added a couple of slices of portobello mushrooms and paired the muffins with homemade beef sausage. I did attempt freezing these \"muffins\" to grab and go as suggested. Either I did something wrong wrapping the omelet muffins or this is just a bad idea. The omelet muffins were really...juicy when defrosted and full of ice crystals when frozen. I only kept them in the freezer for a week. Normally I have non-fat vanilla Greek yogurt with mixed berries (strawberries, blueberries, black berries and raspberries) for breakfast(23g of protein) so I decided to try this to see if it was worth the work switching out to a hot breakfast. Mostly? No. Naked Persian Turkey Burgers (served with Persian Salad) - pg 156 On first bite, these Turkey Burgers were in desperate need of more : more salt, more flavor. It wasn't until the second bite that the flavors hit me. The Naked Persian Turkey Burgers have a rather different flavor profile but it was tasty enough. I did want to add more salt (I didn't) but I feel a lack of salt. In defense of The Skinnytaste Cookbook , I really like salt. The zucchini in the burgers kept them so moist I was shocked. I tried using zucchini in a regular burger and it worked so well! And you couldn't taste the zucchini at all. I made the Naked Burgers and the Persian salad to take for lunch and it was moderately filling. No matter how I contorted, I was still very hungry by the end of the work day. If I make this again, I will have to eat it with something a little more filling. Buttermilk Oven \"Fried\" Chicken - pg 151 So. This tasted fine (if a little buttery) BUT I will not make this again. There are just too many steps considering the outcome. I found that flipping the chicken was the worst part of the cooking process: I lost a lot of the \"breading\" at that time. While this is lower calorie than traditional fried chicken, I'd rather just eat traditionally fried chicken as a treat/special occasion instead of making this. Mongolian Beef and Broccoli - pg 190 This is tasty! Very tasty! I put in a little too much brown sugar so it's a bit sweeter than it should be - but it's still amazingly delicious. This one is a major hit with Hubby. I served this alone and with rice. Love it both ways! Slow-Cooker Picadillo - pg 193 So easy but delicious! I spent a lot of time tasting this as it was cooking...with a lot of burning of the tongue, lol. I'm really enjoying these ground beef recipes for lunch. I tried it with rice (basmati) which was fine. BUT then I used it as taco meat in a very simple (and light) taco: soft shell tortilla, .25 oz cheddar jack, some diced mini heirloom tomatoes and diced red onion. OMG. OMG! YUM. Irresistible Vegetable Medley - pg 274 This recipe is pretty simple and delicious! I've made something quite like this before but in honor of my SkinnyTaste Cookbook, I decided to gussy this recipe up a little. I used purple cauliflower instead of regular cauliflower. Please note: purple cauliflower is genetically more like broccoli and has different nutritional value. I also have tried a decent handful of the recipes located on the Skinnytaste blog. These are delicious, too. I find that the Skinnytaste blog is a great place to go when I'm out shopping and didn't meal plan. I just pick something tasty right from the blog.

            "⚠ Translation error: Her techniques to \"lighten\" food are pretty traditional - lower the fat content in cooking methods (less oil, air frying), lower fat cheeses, less cheeses. As the old school Ornish low-fat diet is now out of fashion in favor of Keto, Neanderthal, Whole #, IIFYM, Some Beach, etc etc, this is actually sort of refreshing. There's nothing wrong with following the moderate low fat diet, it has been shown in studies to have nice long term health benefits (i.e. Mediterranean diet), it's just not \"cool\" right now. However the recipes still remind me of my mother's down home cookin' in the height of her 90s Weight Watcher days. Boneless skinless chicken. Brown rice. Low fat cheese. Egg white omelets. More boneless skinless chicken, now on top of salads. Some of these recipes have that whiff of the accursed WW \"zero point\" category, which never made sense to me as a kid. Of course the highest excesses of the 90s are gone, like fake sugar. But thumbing through this book gave me a combo of nostalgia and painful emotional connection to my mother and her constant desperate battle in and out of the plus size section. In short, this book made me sad, and that's not its fault, but it sure makes me not want to cook from it. If you are a meatist and you don't have lingering 90s diet baggage you will probably love this book, as everyone else seems to. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: Erin Jean Warde shares her perspective as an Episcopal priest with a former alcohol problem, explaining how struggled to change her relationship with alcohol because of the drinking culture in her church and denomination. She writes about how harmful alcohol-related cultural norms and expectations are, both in society at large and within progressive churches, and she shares stark realities about alcohol that few people are aware of due to cultural discomfort, the desire to justify drinking, and the alcohol industry's influence at all levels of society, including government-funded research projects. When she began her sobriety journey, Warde hoped that God would let her keep it private, but thankfully, that didn’t work out. She shares her personal experience here without oversharing, and she informs the reader about the depths of deception and harm in the alcohol industry, the effects of alcohol, and ways that people can change their relationship to alcohol to live better lives. Warde doesn't shame people who drink, but she celebrates the wonders of sobriety, making it clear just how much she missed out on for years by living in an alcohol-induced haze. She also writes about how even though people often turn to alcohol to numb out from trauma, alcohol usage itself often traps people in a state of trauma due to its effect on the brain and body and the various consequences that follow from drinking to excess. I wish that Warde had mentioned generational cycles of alcohol dependency, with people suffering from alcohol-fueled abuse at home and then becoming addicted as well, but she covers many other relevant dynamics. Powerful Truth-Telling Warde shares hard truths without being harsh, and she encourages the \"sober curious\" to discover a better life and a better version of themselves by changing their relationship with alcohol, regardless whether they choose total abstinence or not. Warde challenges common myths about giving up drinking, and she shares a powerful message of compassion for people who suffer. I wish that her talk about self-forgiveness and self-compassion had been balanced out by more talk about forgiveness from God, but I loved her representation of the prodigal son story. Warde writes that when she decided to become sober, she was afraid to tell people because drinking felt like a requirement in her church. It was like a badge of honor to show that you're cool, fun, and not a fundamentalist. She calls out ways that progressive church communities harm others by caring more about alcohol than the destruction it unleashes in people's lives, and she addresses specific counterarguments that Christians often bring up, such as the role of alcohol in the Bible. After explaining how alcohol in Bible times was different in both its content and cultural context, she also unpacks the timeless warnings of Proverbs 23 against drunkenness. She encourages churches that use wine as part of communion to avoid irreverent jokes and to provide non-alcoholic alternatives, just as they might offer gluten-free communication wafers. This book is definitely intended for Christians, and not just because of the church-related advice. Warde writes a lot about death and resurrection, God's love, and spiritual healing, but she rarely unpacks what this means. People who aren't Christians can still benefit from this book, due to the author’s compassionate, non-shaming spirit and highly readable presentation of important information, but they should be aware of how pervasive Christian language and concepts are throughout the book. Conclusion Sober Spirituality will appeal to people who are struggling with drinking and want to change, and to those who want to change the discourse around drinking in their environment. Although Warde writes from a very different denominational perspective from mine, people in my denomination have often moved towards permissive attitudes about drinking to distance themselves from their legalistic forebears. One thing this book indirectly challenged me on was to stop using my health issues and dietary restrictions as a way to deflect discussion about me not drinking, when I would rather just say that alcohol is trauma-inflicting poison, and that I do not want to put anything that toxic into my body or support such a predatory industry. This book helped empower me again to say what I really think, instead of feeling like I have to focus on not offending people. I would encourage Christians to read this regardl --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: without which things cannot come to be. When male energy is absent, creation does not happen, either in the human soul or in the world. Nurturance happens, support and love happen, which is the wonderful feminine gift, but not that new “creation out of nothing” that is the unique prerogative associated with the masculine side of God. If men are not led through the stages and experiences of grief, which will always feel like dying, they end up suffering even more through the neurotic pains of aimless depression, desperation, various forms of addiction and even suicidal temptations. Do not get rid of your hurts until you have learned all that they have to teach you. Much of early men’s work is teaching men how to trust their time in the belly of the whale, how to stay there without needing to fix, to control or even to fully understand it, and to wait until God spits you up on a new shore. It is called “liminal space,” and I believe all in-depth transformation takes place inside of liminal space. To hope too quickly is to hope for the wrong thing. The belly of the whale is the great teaching space, and thus it is no surprise that Jesus said that “the sign of Jonah was the only sign he was going to give” (Luke 11:30). The best way to be a hateful person and not to feel an ounce of guilt about it is to be hateful for God. Jesus forms a healthy community of men as a living alternative to the dysfunctional ways that men usually organize themselves. The church was supposed to be that alternative society, it was intended to be God’s “new world order.” But if you cannot find that Jesus energy in your church or parish, gather with a group of honest brothers who can protect you from and affirm you in something other than passivity (the withered hand) and negativity (scribes and Pharisees). You cannot do it alone. This alienation between sons and fathers is a major reason why many men become either powerless or power-wielding, instead of calmly holding their power like Jesus. How you do anything is finally how you do everything. How you do relationship is how you do relationship—with your job, your family, animals, nature, the present moment and God. When they hate or fear, you love back. That contains it and transforms the person over time. That is what God does in a consummate form and is actually what we mean by Jesus “taking away the sin of the world.” He absorbs our evil, does not return it, and gradually we let go of it. He steals it from us; he takes away our sin! Good friends and true elders do the same on a much smaller scale. The young boy represents a love that comes about through being wounded, and the old man represents love that is willing to wound. We just call it tough love today, but men know they need it, they do respect it, even though very few seniors have the authority to know how to do it well, and very few juniors have the trust to know how to take it well… A healthy and earnest young man is willing to let himself be wounded because he trusts the old man’s love for him, and he believes in the goal. Maleness is indeed about power, but power for good, power for others, power for life and creativity. For a mature man in the second half of life, heroism is no longer the goal or concern. Now the goal is something that we can no longer manufacture, control or even possess as our own: holiness. Holiness is given and received; it is utterly but quietly transforming. “You may be 38 years old, as I happen to be. And one day, some great opportunity stands before you and calls you to stand up for some great principle, some great issue, some great cause. And you refuse to do it because you are afraid… You refuse to do it because you want to live longer… You’re afraid that you will lose your job, or you are afraid that you will be criticized or that you will lose your popularity, or you’re afraid that somebody will stab you, or shoot at you or bomb your house; so you refuse to take the stand. Well you may go on and live until you are 90, but you’re just as dead at 38 as you would be at 90. And the cessation of breathing in your life is but the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit.” Martin Luther King, Jr. Judgmentalism and righteousness is not so much seeking truth as it is seeking control. The joyful acceptance of a limited world, of which I am only a small moment and limited part—this is probably the clearest indication of a man in his fullness. What he once fought for—perfect freedom—he now finds e --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: I've read a few books by Rohr, and I'm a fan. But this book was a disappointment. It was published in 2024, but apparently it originated in 1990. I was a fan of the men's spirituality movement that started with Robert Bly's Iron John: A Book About Men in 1990. It was goofy in some ways, but it started me thinking about things that I hadn't before. There were a lot of problems, but they could be forgiven because it was a new perspective. Rohr's book dates from those early days, apparently, and has supposedly been updated a few times over the years. But it is basically the same old story. Now, 35 years later, I'm not still ready to forgive. The main problem is endless generalities and stereotypes. It begins with stereotypes about how men are and how women are. But then, since those are so obviously overblown, it becomes--well, we all have both the male and the female types within us, just in different proportions. But then why are we still identifying them as male and female? But we quickly move back to what men are like--but there are no actual empirical studies, just generalizations that fit the author's ideas. And there are claims about correlations between upbringings and characteristics with no evidence. And when there are obvious exceptions, it turns out that upbringings can sometimes have the OPPOSITE effect--so, saving the claim. I would have given this one star, but Rohr does have some interesting things to say.

Sorry. This book sold itself to me as something simple. At first I felt deceived. At first it seemed to me that something simple should not take so many words. It's simply complicated. Twelve simple words? That's like a sermon with 18 simple points. It could be that Brian does not write it simply. Or I could just be a lot dumber than I thought. Either option is on the table. I'll let you decide. But then I got past the introductory chapters. This may just be a me thing, but I prefer to see an author say what he's going to write about and then simply start writing about it. Because once I got into the heart of this book, I actually enjoyed it. The premise is actually quite simple. Brian writes of 12 simple words that can help us focus through four seasons of life. The seasons are simplicity, complexity, perplexity and harmony. We may go through all of these seasons more than once and most will cycle through a few times. This is not intended to be a straight linear path. This is more proposed to be a winding circle as we go through the seasons of life. Early on in the preface, Brian writes the following; You won't find much in the way of aggressive arguments here, but rather a shy experience daring to step into the light. ... You won't need to agree with all the planks of my theological platform. I am a Christian, and all I write flows from my experience in that rich tradition, but you may be of another tradition entirely or of no known tradition at all. Those couple of statements can be seen as both positive and negative. On the one hand, he clearly states he is a Christian. This is a good thing, because there are points that seem so muddled that I began to wonder. I had to repeatedly remind myself that we didn't have to agree on everything. On the other hand, because Brian said this was not a book of theological arguments, it leaves him free to assume that we're all on the same page as far as how truth is interpreted. There are some obvious ways that he and I would differ in what we believe (which I will purposely avoid in this review for the sake of brevity). But there were times in which I had to seriously consider if his premise still held value considering the foundation of his points were shaky at best. In the end, if you can look past where we would not agree and choose to look for what can be agreed upon, this book can be very much like sitting down with a friend over coffee and talking about how the two of you manage this thing we call life. I'd say that as long as you know what you believe, this book is worth the read. I received this book from my great friends at The Ooze ( http://theooze.com ). They tell me to say something about the book, but not what to say. And so I do. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: Award-winning blogger and best-selling cookbook author, Gina Homolka, has released her latest cookbook, Skinnytaste Fast and Slow, filled with slow-cooker and quick-fix recipes. I discovered the Skinnytaste website over a year ago, and it quickly turned into a resource to find nutritious and flavorful recipes to prepare at home. I have Homolka’s first cookbook, which is one I always come back to, so when this released, I was looking forward to getting a copy for my collection. As most cookbooks, there is an introduction and recipe key is followed by all the information you’ll need to get your kitchen stocked and prepared for cooking, along with fast cooking basics, and slow-cooker secrets. The next section is a Month of Good-For-Your Meals; 4 weeks of meal planning for breakfast, snacks, lunch, dinner, and treats that include the page number to locate each recipe. There are 11 recipes selections: Healthy Mornings; Chilis, Soups, and Stews; One-Bowl Meals; Zoodles, Squashta, Pasta, and Sauce; Taco Night; Poultry Mains; Meat Lover Mains; Fish and Seafood Mains; Meatless Mains; On the Side; and The Sweeter Side. At the beginning of each section there is an introduction page that includes a list of the recipes with page numbers, and icons to indicate whether the dish is under 30 minutes, pressure cooker, slow cooker, vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free, or freezer-friendly. Some insight from the author, serving size, ingredients, and nutrition key are along side every recipe. Throughout the cookbook you can find food facts, time saving tips, perfect pairings, and Skinny Scoop. There are recipes in here for every occasion, season, and even those picky-eaters. All are healthy, but full of flavor while giving you that freedom to change up some of the ingredients to make it to your liking. Recipes like chicken and zucchini noodles with black bean sauce, and zoodles with shrimp and feta, make me impatient for the warm months to prepare those dishes for my family. There are recipes like slow-cooker hamburger stroganoff that take typical box meals and give you an easy-to-follow guide on preparing a healthy, homemade meal that can still be affordable while on a budget. The photography in this cookbook is beautiful, and the images will make your mouth water before you get to cooking. It is a well crafted cookbook that is sturdy with an easy-to-follow layout. Skinnytaste Fast and Slow offers a variety of dishes that will please all palates around the dinner table, whether you are looking for a quick-fix or slow-cooked meal, you will find hearty comfort food for these winter months, or refreshing, vibrant meals to prepare through spring and summer.

            "⚠ Translation error: Full disclosure: Not only did I win this book through LibraryThing’s Early Reviewers program in exchange for an honest review but in fall 1972 I took a college class, Modern American Novel, and the author was the professor. (I rarely feel old but between this book and my next book, about the Altamont concert, I'm feeling kind of old, or at the least long-lived.) I read a not for sale uncorrected proof paperback advance edition that has 280 pages. I read it over 14 days, taking my time because I was reading it concurrently with a novel and other materials. I'm thinking I should have waited for a library copy edition, the finished hardcover, but I might not have borrowed it in the very near future, and I do enjoy advance copies. I have reserved a copy at the library to read any content changed from or not included in my unfinished edition. First the good because overall I enjoyed this very much: I love the storytelling that goes on all the way through and that frames the jokes. The author’s personal stories and the historical accounts are interesting. I appreciated the writing style, the chattiness of it, and felt as though I was with the author being told stories, and that was fun. Very engaging and entertaining! I loved most of the jokes. I was surprised by how many of the jokes I knew. I’d heard most of them. While I rarely actually laughed as I read, I was highly amused and found the book extremely enjoyable. I equally enjoyed the jokes I already knew and those I was hearing for the first time. The negatives for me were enough to deduct slightly more than one star from a book I might otherwise have rated 5 stars. While the personal stories were a plus, especially of the author’s early years but more current ones as well, I found the incessant name-dropping annoying. I was almost literally rolling my eyes, frequently. Many of the names will be known to most as they are very famous people and others are locally well known. I suspect that the publisher thought that mentioning all these people, friends and interviewees of the author, would be a plus in the book’s sales. I would have preferred much less content about famous people. I felt that most of the time doing so was completely unnecessary for presenting the jokes and stories about their backgrounds. I’m not saying that sometimes it wasn’t a fun presentation technique, but there was way too much of it for me. I’m not sure that I always notice name-dropping but here it was impossible to not notice. That is the main negative for me. The second negative is that I wish it had delved even deeper, especially with general history and with psychological meanings and how they pertain to Jewish humor and to specific jokes. There is some of that but not as much as I’d expected, and most of it was common sense. There was no analysis I found earth shattering or that even provided much information new to me. I thought I’d learn more than I did. A third issue is the misspellings, but it is an advance copy so I can forgive all, except that the last name of one of the author’s friends is misspelled, and not just in the book proper but also in the Acknowledgements section at the end. I hope all the spelling errors will be corrected in the final for sale edition of the book. I am Jewish but I was raised not only without religion but also without the Jewish culture. Most of what I learned when young about Judaism came from reading about Jews and Jewish history and reading books by Jewish people, and from two friends who were raised in observant Jewish homes. And yet I feel very Jewish. I do miss the application my city’s Jewish Community Center used to have for their gym, the boxes where a religion was chosen. Only about ½ the members are Jewish but there were many choices for what kind of Jewish an applicant was affiliated with, and one of the options which I always chose was “just Jewish” which is how I feel. Given my lack of background I was a bit surprised by how familiar the jokes were to me. I don’t know if that’s because of my many Jewish friends or because Jewish humor has made its way into the mainstream. I’m assuming it’s the latter. I finished the book 6 days prior to its official publication date and am posting this review 5 days before it will be available for sale. I feel lucky to have been able to read it early, and I’m glad that I read it. I can definitely recommend it to readers who are interested in its topic. Contents: Introduction I.

            "⚠ Translation error: Written by a host with a show on NPR and a Professor of English Literature, this erudite author delivers, big time. A fantastic compendium of his niche interest with commentaries that are exemplary and akin to Rambam. This is not just a compilation of jokes throughout the last one hundred years or so, but a compendium juxtaposed with relevant narrative. Unlike Cioran, La Rochefoucauld, and The Silver Palate Cookbook, this book is special in how it inserts some creative ideas of others entwined with a current and sensitive purview in which he is, as a writer, a part of the whole. I only wish he would/could write on other topics that he is familiar with. A funny and reflective journey.

            "⚠ Translation error: 'Let There be Laughter' written by Michael Krasny, who is a Professor of English Literature and host of the noted NPR show 'The Forum'. He previously authored 'The Spiritual Envy-An Agnostic's Quest', in which he tried to answer the principal question about whether we can live this life according to our own code without the need and aid of faith or spiritual belief in a deity? I read that book several times and it used it as a guid on my own path to secularism. So I was extremely excited when Professor's Krasny's new book was announced and I pre ordered it as soon as it became available to purchase. I have had the pleasure to have taken a few courses with Professor Krasny. His class lectures are equivalent to an enchanting theatrical performance. His wonderful collection of lectures on 'Masterpieces of Short Fiction' have been recorded by 'Great Courses' company and can be purchased online. Myself being previously used to stoic Engineering Professors, thought these attributes of mixing humor, storytelling, and teaching must be shared amongst all the Professors of the Humanities; but after having taken several more courses in the literary arts, I have come to the final conclusion that, in deed, Professor Krasny is rather unique. And very much celebrated too; his classes fill out auditoriums, his radio show is listened by a multitude of people everyday; and even the Mayor of San Francisco declared Michael Krasny Day on the 20th anniversary of his radio show. This new book 'Let There Be Laughter: A Treasury of Great Jewish Humor and What It All Means' is a collection of Jewish jokes accumulated by Professor Krasny throughout his life. The book is written in the same style and voice familiar to all of Krasny's fans and reading the book transported me back into his classroom. I could visualize him in front of me, telling these stories utilizing all of his tonal variations. There are two seminal questions the book tries to answer; First is the question of humor i.e what is in fact humor and the second why are Jews considered funny? Professor Krasny deems humor to be an another form of storytelling, that reveals some truth, albeit in a comical way. The book is divided into eight distinct categories of jokes where Professor Krasny lists the jokes and then gives personal anecdotes and explains the context. I personally enjoyed the last four categories the most: 'Yiddish Generation, Celebration, Suffering, and Separate & Distinct'. Professor Krasny reveals that characteristics such as assimilating in a new place, fear of loss of identity, holding on to tradition, pressure to succeed, etc, are some of the main crux of the Jewish jokes. But I believe that these characteristics are shared by all migrant communities. Humor could also be a vehicle to pass on tradition to the future generation, in danger of losing their heritage in the new world. Being a Pakistani living in the US, I could very easily relate with Jewish Humor exhibited by Professor Krasny. Replace the Rabbi with an Imam, the Jewish Mother with an Indian Auntie, and the joke switches from being Jewish to Indian/Muslim/Pakistani etc. Recently an Anthology of short stories was published in the US by women from the Indian subcontinent origin titled \"Good Girls Marry Doctors\", also a theme of jokes listed in Professor Krasny's book. So then, humor is not only a form of story telling, but is also a way to bring people together. The characters in these jokes may be of different race, ethnicities, religions; but there is something very crucial that they all share-and that is their humanity. And this is what in the end this book \"Let there be Laughter\" reminds us all of. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: Một cuốn sách hay với những chia sẻ và hướng dẫn sâu sắc (nhưng cũng không kém phần thách thức để thực hành) cho những con người không ngừng nỗ lực vươn lên trong cuộc sống. - Theo đúng đạo làm người là thế nào? Cụ thể là: Ngay thẳng, chính trực, không tham lam, không ích kỉ, không dối trá, không làm hại người khác, ... Tất cả những nguyên tắc đạo đức giản dị trên đây - ai cũng từng được cha mẹ dạy từ thuở thơ ấu, nhưng khi lớn lên thường quên mất - đã trở thành kim chỉ nam, thành phương châm kinh doanh, thành chuẩn mực hành xử của công ty. Dù lúc đó tôi chưa có hiểu biết bao nhiêu về kinh doanh nhưng tôi tin tưởng tuyệt đối rằng bất kể kinh doanh kiểu nào, nếu vi phạm và đi ngược với đạo đức làm người thì thất bại. - Mỗi quốc gia, mỗi dân tộc đều có nền văn hoá khác nhau. Nhưng các nguyên tắc cơ bản trong kinh doanh hay trong cuộc sống đều giống nhau. Ví dụ, nỗ lực để đạt kết quả trong công việc, hay suy nghĩ muốn làm việc thiện cho đời, tất cả những điều đó đều là chân lý phổ biến dù có sự khác biệt về văn hoá hay tôn giáo như thế nào đi chăng nữa. -\"Đặt vào vị trí cao những người có đức cao, ban vật chất cho kẻ có nhiều tài.\" Tức là đối với người chỉ có tài thì trả thù lao lớn là được, còn đối với những người có đức cao thì hãy đặt họ vào địa vị xứng đáng. Có thể nói, lời khuyên cách đây hơn một trăm năm của Saigo Takamori vẫn đúng với hôm nay. Có lẽ chính trong thời đại mà luân thường đạo lý bị băng hoại thì chúng ta càng phải ghi nhớ câu nói này. - Thông qua sự cần cù, con người sẽ có được đời sống tinh thần phong phú và trở nên có nhân cách. Tôi cho rằng, niềm vui thực sự mà con người có được chính là ở trong lao động. Nói đến đây chắc bạn sẽ phản đối: \"Suốt cuộc đời chỉ biết có công việc thì thật vô vị, phải có sở thích và thú vui nữa chứ?\" Nhưng sở thích và thú vui chỉ thực sự được cảm nhận nếu chúng ta thoả mãn với công việc. Nếu làm việc qua loa đại khái, dù có tìm được niềm vui trong thế giới riêng của mình thì cũng chỉ là nhất thời. Chắc chắn nó không thể là niềm vui trào lên từ sâu thẳm trong tâm hồn. Lẽ dĩ nhiên niềm vui trong công việc không đơn giản như khi chúng ta cảm nhận được vị ngọt của viên kẹo trong miệng. Đúng như câu cách ngôn: \"Lao động gồm có rễ đắng và trái ngọt\", chỉ khi lao động cực nhọc và vất vả mang lại thành quả, chúng ta mới cảm nhận được niềm vui. Niềm vui trong công việc có được khi ta vượt qua cảm giác vất vả và cực nhọc. Chính vì vậy niềm vui có được trong lao động khác hẳn với những niềm vui khác và những niềm vui thông thường không thể thay thế được. - Việc mài giũa nhân cách không đòi hỏi những kỹ thuật tu luyện phức tạp. Chúng ta chỉ cần lặng lẽ, kiên trì với công việc hàng ngày, thực hiện nghiêm túc vai trò được giao phó dù đó là việc công hay việc cá nhân, dù là lao động kiếm sống hay học hành. Tất cả những việc đó đều giống như quá trình tu hành, đều phải tận tâm tận lực hàng ngày. Có thể nói việc mài giũa nhân cách, nâng cao tâm hồn hay con đường đến giác ngộ tồn tại ngay trong lao động hàng ngày. - Câu chuyện này đã xa xưa lắm rồi, cách đây hơn 40 năm, thời công ty Kyocera vẫn còn trứng nước. Tôi đã từng nói với các nhân viên mới, vừa tốt nghiệp đại học, trong buổi lễ gia nhập công ty: \"Từ trước đến nay, các bạn sống trong sự nuôi nấng đùm bọc của cha mẹ, nhà trường và xã hội. Từ giờ phút này, các bạn đã thực sự trưởng thành và đến lượt mình làm việc cho xã hội. Kể từ nay, các bạn không được phép mang theo ý nghĩ chờ đợi mọi người phải làm gì đó cho mình nữa. Các bạn phải thay đổi 180 đọ vị trí của mình, từ 'được nhận' chuyển sang 'làm cho'...\" Sở dĩ tôi muốn kể lại câu chuyện này là vì khi Kyocera còn nhỏ bé, các chế độ phúc lợi chưa đầy đủ, những nhân viên mới tốt nghiệp đại học, vào làm ở công ty chưa được bao lâu thường hay kêu ca phàn nàn: \"Tưởng công ty này lớn, hoá ra đồng lương thì thấp, chế độ phúc lợi cũng chẳng ra sao.\" Nghe như vậy, tôi rất bực: \"Đúng là công ty vẫn còn nhỏ. Thiết bị sản xuất cũng như các chế độ đãi ngộ đều thiếu thốn. Nhưng để làm cho công ty lớn hơn, phúc lợi đầy đủ hơn thì không ai khác mà chính là các bạn. Các bạn đừng chờ đợi những gì có sẵn mà chính các bạn phải tạo ra chúng. Những người chỉ muốn 'được nhận', chỉ muốn hưởng thụ điều người khác làm cho mình chính là những người hay để ý đến sự thiếu thốn, hay than vãn kêu ca. Nhưng đã là người trưởng thành thì phải nhìn nhận ở góc độ ngược lại, tứ là phải 'làm cho' người khác. Để trở thành người như vậy, các bạn phải thay đổi 180 độ nhân sinh quan, thế giới quan của mình.\". - Triết lý k --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",
            "⚠ Translation error: A Compass to Fulfillment is not a traditional business book based on research data; rather, this is a compilation of the learning and wisdom of Kazuo Inamori, founder of Kyocera and KDDI, two Fortune 300 companies. It is well worth reading, and slots right in to my own worldview. Consider some of the following drawn from his writing: 1. Striving daily to do one's best in this material world is the key to building character and refining our souls. \"Focus fully on the task before you without allowing yourself to become distracted -- that is shojin. 2. \"Instead of perfecting the work, we should perfect the person who performs it.\" Reminds me of this quote from Ezra Taft Benson: “The Lord works from the inside out. The world works from the outside in. The world would take people out of the slums. Christ would take the slums out of people, and then they would take themselves out of the slums. The world would mold men by changing their environment. Christ changes men, who then change their environment. The world would shape human behavior, but Christ can change human nature.” 3. \"...our thoughts generate impulses that become reality. Therefore, the way we think is extremely important and should be kept free from negativity...we should never paint a negative image in our minds. Strong thoughts manifest as real experience, and the mental images we create shape our lives.\" 4. \"We need a pure heart when thinking about our way fo life because good thoughts, particularly thoughts that are focused on service to others, are in alignment with the original intent of the universe.\" 5. \"A vague, halfhearted desire will never lead to results...All success in life start with a strong desire to do something. I repeatedly think through the entire process of working toward my goal, eliminating any ineffective strategies my mind devises and revising and reworking my plan each time. If I stick tenaciously to this process, I begin to see the path toward success as if it were a road I have taken before.\" 6. \"It is...essential to think in the future tense: The person I am right now may not be able to do this, but my future self can do it. We must believe that untapped powers lie dormant within us.\" 7. \"It is the ability to plod away without complaint, to never give up, to continuously do one's best each day, that transforms ordinary people into extraordinary people.\" 8. \"How can we acquire an enthusiastic nature? The best way is to fall in love with one's work...No matter what your job is, if you put your heart and soul into it, you will gain satisfaction and self-confidence and want to set out to achieve the next goal. As you repeat this process, achieving goal after goal, you will come to love your work even more...\" Seems to me that this is a key to learning to want what you don't want, but know you should... 9. Quoting Saigo Takamori (1827-1877) -- \"To men of high virtue, give high office; to men of many achievements, give cash.\" 10. \"More than ability or eloquence, leaders need depth of character. They must be humble, introspective, and disciplined; they must have the courage to defend justice and the love to continually refine their souls. They must strive constantly to do what is right as human beings.\" 11. \"The elevation of the soul is the purpose, the meaning of our lives. Life is nothing other than the process of refining our true nature as human beings.\" 12. \"The habit of daily reflection, which is crucial to refining a person's character, is actually the product of maintaining an open mind...Opportunities for self-reflection help us recognize our faults such as arrogance, pride, conceit, and carelessness and reinforce our guiding principles and self-discipline.\" --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: against one another in the presence of paying spectators, comedy pits the fighter against the paying customers, with silence as the killer, and the detonation of laughter as the victory. The detonation depends on tension. Without the tension the joke can't work. I'm still thinking about her idea that if laughter is the best medicine, one must watch out for overdosing. The part about Stalin's purges and the execution of Jewish comics -- that I get, but she's saying something broader. She puts her overdose warning into various contexts throughout the book, and I haven't put it all together. Heine broke out of humor into anger, and Kafka into grief. As Wisse observes, laughter isn't very far from tears. But, as they say, leave 'em laughing: (Thanks to the Facebook group Jewish Humor) It’s Shabbat and the family is ready to say the traditional blessing over wine. The youngest boy has forgotten to wear a kippah and as he begins to recite the blessing, his father places his brothers’ hand over the younger boy’s head. The older boy pulls it back. The father places it over the younger boy’s head again. Again, the older boy pulls his hand away. Finally, his father asked why he would not help out. His son responded, “Am I my brother’s kippah?” Last, bad puns, but appropriate to Tzadic Valentine's Day: Leave 'em thinking too: why might those sorts of jokes be predominant in that Facebook group? Another point is that Ruth Wisse doesn't identify essential differences between Jewish and other humor; says at one point she thought to hold up Jewish humor as verbal, but eventually physical humor also emerged. It's all good! Here's one more I just love that I found today on Facebook: a No Exit cartoon I couldn't find online last night. 😄 I will consider not amending this review time and time again with more jokes and cartoons.... --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: ... so I'm perplexed. this should be a really interesting and enjoyable book. but it just wasn't. now, we know it's not just a collection of Jewish jokes (which, in retrospect, would have been a better call) - the author's an academic (a Harvard professor, no less) and the title warns us. yet this book doesn't really seem to be much of anything. as an academic work it just doesn't make the grade; it feels like what you get when you send a lot of grad students out to the library to generate the ballast, then stitch it together with a couple of simple ideas and some personal insights and anecdotes - in itself a time-tested formula, and one that could even work, if the insights were profound enough, the anecdotes interesting, and the research deep and broad enough. this feels like a set of essays, which have yet to be coherently strung together with a powerful unifying theme and flow of logic. it feels like you're sitting at a dinner table, next to someone who doesn't stop talking. but not only is the big picture missing the mark - even the details are infuriating. perfectly wonderfully simple jokes are explained and dissected in ways that add no value. (we got it the first time!) in other places, sweeping assumptions are made, with no justification or explanation. even the grammar/spelling is shoddy (look up \"acronym\" and \"cache\" before using them!) the sad fact is, the author doesn't seem to have a sense of humour. or maybe she just has to work on her delivery. i was also a little thrown by her early reduction of the scope possibilities to: either Jews are essentially funny, and have always been so; or Jews are basically really boring, but started cracking jokes a little over 100 years ago. she went for the latter, which i assumed was a way of limiting the research workload... but there may have been another agenda: if there is a theme here, it's that Jews may be funny, but it's been done under duress, and Jews should not be branded as god-given comedic talents (least of all by Jews themselves.) or maybe i just didn't get it. i mean, apart from the above, this is a really good book. and the subject matter is, of course, ripe, fruity and delicious. and bitter. and so on. however, as the author states, there is already plenty of literature already published on the subject. perhaps try another book instead? --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: Book Review: The Essential Canning Cookbook by Molly Bravo Rating: 4.5 Stars I just finished The Essential Canning Cookbook by Molly Bravo, and honestly, I’m so impressed! If you’ve ever wanted to learn how to preserve all those fresh fruits and veggies from your garden or farmer’s market, this book is a fantastic place to start — whether you’re a total newbie or have some experience under your belt. Molly’s approach really brings canning back to basics but in the best way possible. The book walks you through everything you need to know about safe canning methods like water bath and pressure canning, plus pickling, with clear, step-by-step instructions. I love how she emphasizes preserving the true flavor of each season’s bounty — so you’re not just storing food, but capturing that peak freshness and nutrition to enjoy all year long. One thing I really appreciated is that the recipes are preservative-free, so you have full control over what goes into your jars. It’s a great way to eat healthier and avoid unnecessary additives. Plus, the book shows how canning can actually save you money by turning your garden’s overflow into delicious pantry staples that rival anything you’d buy in the store. The month-by-month canning guide is such a smart feature — it helps you plan ahead and make the most of what’s in season. Honestly, the whole book is packed with useful info and easy recipes (101 of them!). I do wish there were a few more photos sprinkled throughout, but the layout is clean and really easy to follow. Also, gotta say, the cover is super inviting! I can totally see this being an ideal gift for anyone curious about canning but not sure where to start. Overall, The Essential Canning Cookbook makes preserving food approachable, fun, and rewarding. Definitely 4.5 stars from me! ⚠️This review was written based on personal opinions and experiences with the book.

However, I feel the cookbook is missing some details. Most cookbooks include a brief introduction for each of the recipes, and it would have been nice if this cookbook did that to explain the cultural background and relevance to Christmas. For example, it would have been nice to know the background of Pfeffernusse as they are traditional German cookies or the connection of a Flourless Chocolate Torte to Christmas. Also, none of the recipes list any dietary allergins or restrictions or include nutritional information. The Christmas Baking Cookbook is a great selection of baking recipes, but do not expect any information about each recipe beyond the ingredients and directions.

            "⚠ Translation error: This is a wonderful cookbook that brings together an incredible variety of recipes from all corners of the culinary world! Some dishes are so unique that you rarely see them in any other cookbook, so it’s fantastic to have them all in one place. This is definitely a cookbook worth considering if you’re on the lookout for something comprehensive and eclectic. The only downside is that the measurements are designed solely for American readers, which means that as a European, I need to convert them—an extra step that can sometimes lead to slight inaccuracies. Additionally—and this is just a thought—it would have been interesting if each recipe included a note about its origin or a bit of backstory. Learning about the cultural context or history behind a dish can really add to the cooking experience. Otherwise, this is a very thorough cookbook, and I plan to try out plenty of recipes from it.

            "⚠ Translation error: I'll be honest: as much as I have wanted and tried to be, I am not a fan of Hannah's for numerous reasons. However, I am a huge fan of the recipes Mrs. Fluke includes in her books, so I bought it for that reason alone. I've already made Hannah's Chicken Salad (a variation of Norman's Egg Salad that is not detailed in this book). It is excellent (as is the egg salad)!!! I found the mixture was a bit dry, though, so I increased the mayo, cream cheese, and sour cream by 1/3 of the amounts initially listed. I will definitely be making it again. I've made several of the recipes (or their original version as in the case of the Whippersnappers). It would have been nice if the original recipe (in addition to the new variation) was listed. And, the Red Velvet Cookies are faves of my sister and nephew. I was able to identify several more recipes I'd like to try in the future. Also, since this is a cookbook, it would have been helpful if the book were in \"cookbook format\" rather than novel format (i.e., lie flat when open). As for the story, I found it unnecessary; by page three, I was reminded why I can't stand Hannah. I would have preferred the story be in one spot rather than scattered throughout the book. And, as a \"non-cook,\" I was a bit put off by the stories of flubs by novice cooks in the book. At least they tried to cook. Still, great as many of the recipes typically turn out to be, I'd buy the next volume detailing further recipes. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: What a fun cookbook! Everyone loves The Princess Bride, and now it’s possible to prepare dishes that most likely were served during the time of The Princess Bride. Recipes can be found in The Princess Bride: The Official Cookbook by Jenn Fujikawa. Fujikawa has included recipes for dishes that we all like, and has given them clever names that relate to the fantasy time period of the movie. She has also added photographs from the movie, as well as vignettes with information about the scenes and characters. The recipes are written in the traditional manner and are easy to follow with step-by-step instructions. They are mouthwatering and mostly easy, so anyone can prepare them, whether or not they are beginning or advanced cooks. There is also a beautiful photograph of almost every recipe; the photographs are beautiful and will bring back memories from the 1987 classic film. Fans of The Princess Bride will welcome not only the recipes, but also how delightful the movie is, and will be inspired to watch it again while eating some of the fun recipes that are included. Although this is not an all-purpose cookbook, it has excellent recipes that readers will actually want to prepare. It should definitely have a place on the cookbook shelves of readers who like to collect cookbooks based on their favorite books and movies. Recommended for Princess Bride fans.

            "⚠ Translation error: This is Lindsay's first cookbook, but the second one I read. I love that her recipes make cooking and eating vegan EASY as well as tasty. Clearly I'm not the only one--she's shot to cooking stardom from her start on her blog, and just look at the raving reviews quoted on the cover and inside this book. Sure, there are the occasional recipes that taste a little odd if you're not used to vegan food. But most people will tell you that if you're trying to go vegan, don't start with making substitute versions of your favorite dishes. Make dishes that are vegan and good, and enjoy those. Then when your palate has adjusted, you can try recreated versions of old favorites. Because, honestly, vegan mac and cheese or lasagna will NEVER taste the same as the original. But you can eventually find healthy versions that are delicious on their own. Basic facts about switching to a low-fat vegan diet, as well as the reasons for/ benefits of such a switch, are covered at the beginning and end of this book. In between are the recipes that are making her famous. With good reason. I'd admit that so far I prefer Everyday Happy Herbivore, her second cookbook, to this one. But I still liked enough of the recipes in this to go out and buy a copy, and I'm slowly working my way through them all. Well, OK, not all of them. This isn't a gluten free cookbook. She's kind enough to label recipes with various icons, one of which is \"gluten-free.\" So I can tell at a glance which ones will likely be safe for me. This being her first cookbook, I noticed that a lot more of the recipes have gluten in them. I can tell by the second one she was making more of an effort to eliminate gluten from recipes, or present it in ways that are easy to substitute. So far I've tried the Tofu Scramble, which is pretty much the same as the one in EHH, but very good. My husband always complains I don't make enough of it. The Aztec Corn Soup was also good; the quinoa gave it a different texture, but not bad, and I liked the taste too. The Garden Chowder was tasty; I served it with biscuits. And the Mexican Cabbage was a little strange--I like cabbage, and I like some Mexican food, but the combination was a little strange. It wasn't bad, and it was very filling. Just odd. I'm looking forward to trying many more of these recipes, though. Especially Hippie Loaf, perhaps with a side of Maple-Glazed Vegetables, Dirty Mashed Potatoes, and/or Veggie Slaw. I'm also looking forward to Tamale Casserole, Bean Cakes, and No-Heuvos Rancheros. The ingredient lists seem reasonable to me, shopping at a normal grocery store, and the assembly is usually much simpler and easier than a lot of other vegan cookbooks I've come across. This isn't gourmet. It's just good (as well as healthy).

            "⚠ Translation error: Haaretz Books The Jewish comic-book revolutionary behind Mad magazine A new biography of Harvey Kurtzman pays tribute to the Jewish artist’s genius but struggles to escape the long shadow of his days at Mad magazine in the 1950s, much like Kurtzman himself. By Akin Ajayi\t| Jun. 19, 2015 | 10:00 PM “Harvey Kurtzman: The Man Who Created MAD and Revolutionized Humor in America,” by Bill Schelly, Fantagraphics Books, 644 pages, $34.99 Sometime in 1988, Harvey Kurtzman invited Art Spiegelman to guest-lecture at his cartooning class at New York’s School of Visual Arts. Spiegelman was already a leading light of the alternative comics movement (he’d win a Pulitzer Prize, in 1992, for “Maus”), and it was expected that he would talk about his career. But instead, Spiegelman turned the spotlight around, talking about the inspiration for his comic-book career – Kurtzman himself. Spiegelman ran through Kurtzman’s early successes, but talked most about Kurtzman’s greatest contribution to comic books, as the creator of Mad magazine (he would later document the afternoon, comic strip-style, in a New Yorker tribute shortly after Kurtzman’s death in 1993). “Mad was an urban junk collage that said ‘Pay attention! The mass media are lying to you … including this comic book!’” Spiegelman told the class. “I think Harvey’s Mad was more important than pot and LSD in shaping the generation that protested the Vietnam War.” Kurtzman’s voice eventually broke the awed silence. “Gee Artie, that was terrific,” he said. “Couldja come back next week and give us the same lecture again?” “Harvey Kurtzman: The Man Who Created MAD and Revolutionized Humor in America,” by comic-book artist and cultural historian Bill Schelly, is a hard-working, exhaustively researched attempt to capture the creative essence of Kurtzman, regarded by many of his peers as the 20th century’s most influential proponent of the comic-book form. Mad, which Kurtzman cofounded, scripted and edited between its inauguration in 1952 and his acrimonious departure in 1956, changed the nature of satire in the United States, permanently. Schelly’s biography places the Mad years at the pinnacle of a 50-year career, one that was distinguished by Kurtzman’s influence on a generation of cartoonists, inspired by his peerless work ethic and inventiveness. Bill Schelly's 'Harvey Kurtzman: The Man Who Created MAD and Revolutionized Humor in America.' (by Fantagraphics) Kurtzman was born in 1924 in Brooklyn, New York, the second son of Jewish migrants from Odessa. His father, a jeweller, died suddenly when Kurtzman was four, leaving the family destitute until his mother Edith remarried. Schelly’s research suggests that Kurtzman’s experiences at that time – the brothers were briefly placed in an orphanage because their mother couldn’t care for them – stayed with him throughout his life. “I appreciated a buck,” Kurtzman would later say. “I was aware of the fact that making a living was hard work.” Schelly states that Kurtzman was strongly influenced by his domestic circumstances. His stepfather, a brass engraver working in printing, was a Communist and trade union activist; Edith closely read the Communist newspapers, comparing their perspective on contemporary events against the mainstream version. “Harvey picked up his mother’s propensity for ‘looking between the lines,’” Schelly notes. “This capacity … became an essential element in his later success as a satirist.” Kurtzman’s artistic abilities manifested themselves early. Comic books, being easier to read than plain text, were a popular diversion for immigrants – children and adults alike. Schelly writes that even from an early age, Kurtzman dreamt of becoming a cartoonist. His family was supportive: his mother paid for extra art lessons, and Kurtzman’s horizons were broadened by regular museum visits. When he was 12, he stumbled across a stash of college humor magazines “on a trash heap, or in someone’s cellar,” along the lines of The Harvard Lampoon. The discovery nudged him along in a particular direction. “It was a major consciousness-raising moment when suddenly I became aware of a certain approach to humor,” Kurtzman later recalled. “It was that quality of parody and satire that was so unique.” In 1937, Kurtzman won a scholarship to the selective High School of Music & Art (M&A). He was a year younger than his classmates, and was rather diffident by nature – according to his older brother, Kurtzman was “stiff as a board.

Me da la impresión que la autora ha querido estirar hasta las 380 páginas algo que se podría explicar igual en 50 páginas. Al inicio, hay muchas páginas en las que escribe sin explicar gran cosa “ya lo explicaré más tarde” “lo abordaremos más adelante”… Luego pone para mi gusto demasiados ejemplos (está bien que no se limite a un único ejemplo, pero quizás después del cuarto o quinto ya quedan las cosas claras). Lo dicho, me parece un libro muy muy largo para algo que se puede explicar en un par de capítulos. Yo no lo he podido terminar, pero como digo, puede ser también porque ya estoy bastante informada sobre el tema. Para gente que no ha leído nada de rabietas y su acompañamiento, el libro puede estar bien. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: Zehr compiles and organizes an impressive number of passages from the scriptures of the world’s major faiths to show how each faith’s beliefs and teachings reflect similar journeys towards spiritual enlightenment and ethical conduct. I like how he calls these similarities “a commonality in our faith traditions.” Zehr’s book, therefore, offers us an inspirational primer about the commonalities among faiths in the hope that developing our knowledge of other religions will enhance our own faith and humanity. I agree with Zehr that divisiveness among religions results from too many believers failing or refusing to understand the scriptures and beliefs of others. Zehr says, “When you walk the enlightened path, you are not settling for the beliefs that have been given to you, but you are willing to question, explore, and seek understanding that aligns you with yourself and God.” Zehr’s advice is sound, and I would add that a path of enlightenment requires a lifelong devotion to continual searching and learning. I never want to be certain or absolute about any my beliefs. Therefore, I keep my heart forever open and my mind forever active to learning more from others. Although I grew up in the Christian tradition, the teachings of other faiths have strengthened my understanding God, in particular my reverence for Islam and the Prophet Muhammad, and so I commend Zehr’s book that works as a guide for eliminating barriers and building bridges through knowledge and reflection about the beliefs of the world’s many faiths, which reveal so many commonalities. My only criticism is that the book reads a little too much like a how-to manual. Although the chapters are short and engaging, it’s not the type of book that is a page-turner. Instead, it’s meant to be absorbed in small pieces with the intent that each chapter serves as a lesson for reflection each day over several weeks. Many readers will find this approach perfect for them. For me, The Peacemaker’s Path is more a superb beginner’s guide to understanding the similarities among faiths rather than a probing study or exploration for those who already embrace the knowledge that can be gained from studying the world’s many religions. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: Fifteen years ago, when Bri McKoy’s husband suggested one night over takeout that perhaps they should learn to cook, she laughed in his face. Bri grew up with a mother who cooked but had always prided herself on her INEXPERIENCE in the kitchen. But Bri took her husband’s suggestion under consideration and headed to Barns & Noble, returning home with a copy of The Cooking Light Cookbook (because she assumed that this meant the cooking would be light, as in easy). Before long she had cooked through the book and mastered the art of following a recipe, yet she still lacked confidence in the kitchen. Over time she learned that there was more to cooking than copying a recipe: “a recipe is an excellent compass, but when we step into the kitchen we become the navigators. The compass is only helpful if we know how to navigate our own kitchen.” In The Cook’s Book, Bri shares her hard-earned wisdom on learning to navigate a kitchen. She begins by helping home cooks create a functional kitchen with suggestions for tools, appliances, and pantry staples every cook needs, as well as a framework for helping kitchen newbies cast a vision for their real kitchen. In subsequent sections Bri teaches us necessary tricks, such as how to deglaze a pan and cook food without having it stick (I needed this section!); how to use all five senses when cooking; and how to select and use a proper knife. There are also sections on meats, soup, sides, sauces, flavor building, and food & wine pairings, with each section providing a varied selection of recipes in addition to important tutorials on things such as selecting the right cut of meat and knowing which sauce to use with which food items. I enjoyed the conversational tone of this cookbook and appreciated Bri’s gentle, informative approach for helping newbie chefs gain confidence in the kitchen. Like Bri, I taught myself to cook from a cookbook shortly after getting married, but I still find myself at the “read the recipe” stage and had several helpful takeaways about how to begin branching out with my cooking. This book, which I would recommend for home cooks with at least some familiarity with cooking (this is not really a beginners cookbook) was just my speed and would make a great housewarming or wedding gift for other new-ish cooks wanting to up their cooking game. While I loved the premise and setup of this cookbook, I would have liked more photographs (including some step-by-step photos of some of the more difficult recipes). And though I’m sure many will appreciate the books detailed tutorials on stocking a home bar cart and paring wines with various dishes, these chapters were of no interest to me as I do not drink or serve alcohol. (I did learn some interesting wine trivia, though!) While this won’t be a forever favorite cookbook for me, I enjoyed reading it cover to cover and have already bookmarked quite a few recipes to try in my own kitchen.

I'm not even vegetarian but I still like recipes and books about vegetables and vegetarian cuisines. I think vegan cookbooks just go too far for me, with all the different replacers that I have no reason to buy.

I think if you already cook a lot of Korean food and don't eat a lot of (or any) meat then this book would be fantastic for you.

This book covers a lot of ground at a surface level… kind of like taking a European Whirl-style tour, where the goal is to see just enough of each location to decide if you want to come back and spend more time there in the future. I like how the book is organized, with the most mainstream topics first, building to the more \"woo woo\" ideas toward the end. I appreciated how Hayley indicated which practices were lifted from other cultures and encouraged readers to do more research into the culture of origin in order to better understand the practices. I found some typos which led to a bit of confusion (the section on psychic skills in particular) and I do wish some topics had been delved into a LITTLE deeper because I felt like the basic information didn't really tell me much. For example, the section on Sacred Geometry had several helpful photos but didn't really explain why any of it mattered. Overall, I'm glad I read this book.

            "⚠ Translation error: This is a really awesome cookbook both for newbie bakers as well as seasoned bakers. I consider myself to be in the latter category, and I found this cookbook to have so many recipes I wanted to try, I did not know where to start. The Back in the Day Bakery Cookbooks has more than 100 recipes from Cheryl Day and Griffith Day, owners of the Back in the Day Bakery in Savannah, GA. The bakery was founded in 2002, and I sincerely hope to visit it some day. The book features a Foreword by Paula Deen, an Introduction, The Method to the Magic (info on the science and operational details of baking), The Baker's Tool Kit (suggested tools every baker should have/what Cheryl and Griff can't live without), and A Peek Inside Our Spice Cabinet (a listing of the spices used in the cookbook's recipes.) Then the book is divided into 9 chapters: Breakfast; Coffee Cakes, Quick Breads, and Sweet Yeast Breads; Cupcakes and Cakes; Pies, Cobblers, Crisps, and Tarts; Puddings and Custards; Cookies; Brownies and Bars; Confections; Savories. The book finishes with a Resources section, Acknowledgments, and an Index. The book is nicely complemented with photos of many of the recipes (just about every other recipe or so includes a photo.) Many of these photos make the recipes look oh so tempting, especially the ones for the S'more Pie, Coconut Cake, and Cinnamon Sticky Buns. So far, my favorite chapter is probably the Breakfast chapter, because I really enjoy making breakfast treats. I've made the Blueberry Muffins and Cinnamon-Sugar Doughnut Muffins and can't wait to try more recipes; this chapter also includes recipes for Baked Eggs, Homemade Jam, Buttermilk Cornmeal Pancakes, and Hot Chocolate Mix. In the other chapters, I've also made Pecan-Chocolate-Espresso Coffee Cake, and Cinnamon-Sour Cream Coffee Cake. I've only had the book for a few weeks, and it's already getting a good workout. I consider it to be a very valuable addition to my ever-growing cookbook collection, and I really look forward to trying more recipes. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

The photo of Cheryl and Griffith Day in their bakery, called Back in the Day Bakery, in Savannah, Georgia, on the cover drew me in - big smiles and lots of character, not to mention some old timey charm. I loved it already! Then, I delved into the book, and what fun and functional recipes I found inside. (The photos are lovely and charming as well.) Before those, however, you find some super-useful sections, like \"The Method to the Magic,\" which explains in plain and simple prose why such things as ingredient temperature, mis en place, understanding the function of each ingredient in a recipe, and (this one has my name all over it) reading the recipe all-the-way-through are so important to successful cooking. A breath of fresh air - and great reminders. Other sections, like \"A Peek Inside Our Spice Cabinet,\" function as honest-to-goodness helpful primers. Then, you get to the good stuff: Recipes! Chapters range from \"Breakfast\" to \"Puddings and Custards\" to \"Brownies and Bars\" to \"Savories.\" I made copies of the recipes I must try - Rustic Peach-Blueberry Tart, Ginger Cake Squares, and Ham and Cheese Pastry Puffs, for example.

            "⚠ Translation error: The Art of War originally written by Sun Tzu is an influential piece of work even today despite being written around the 5th century BCE. Main takeaways: 1. The book isn't limited to wars of the ancient times. Wars are still being fought presently (most completely unnoticed) but the entire scope of them have changed. The strategies mentioned still remain relevant and effective. 2. It transcends beyond war-like situations. For any instance in life when there's a conflict, personal or otherwise, this book probably contains a verse which can provide you with a solution. 3. Even though the book has war in it's title, it doesn't get much into the mechanics of field battle and the physical warfare between soldiers of the army. Rather it focuses on the tactics for the ones in command that could help limit the magnitude of overall destruction. 4. Essentially, it advocates peaceful resolution. Waging war against your enemy is considered to be a last resort as the author clearly recognises the unnecessary loss caused due to battle. Conclusively, this book is as much about peace as it is about war.

It is a republic of free and equal citizens that the bonhomie of the club or dinner table prefigures. In the fourth volume of Tristram Shandy, Sterne speaks of his ambition to construct ‘a kingdom of hearty laughing subjects’. To laugh together is to share a bodily as well as spiritual communion, one whose closest analogy is a festive meal. In this unity of the physical and mental, laughter is a refutation of Cartesian dualism. There is no point to this reciprocity beyond its own self- delight, which is why it has a certain affinity with art. Humour of this kind is an implicit critique of instrumental rationality. It exists purely for the joy of the contact. (114-15) One other book I immediately rushed out (OK, to Amazon.ca) and bought was the collected Plays (vol 1) of the Mancunian leftie Trevor Griffiths, whose irresistible play Comedians takes up much of the exegesis of the otherwise deflationary final chapter. \"That's it? Nothing on the 20C? No Brecht?\" I whined. \"Where's the Prolegomenon to a First Critique of Stewart Lee\" I thought the introduction promised me? Instead, TE moves from Griffiths to an odd recounting of Christianity as a bad joke, ending with: \"There is also a vein of comédie noire in Christianity.

Kersey Graves steadily implies that India was the birthplace of the religion of Christianity, and it was India that taught the world. Unfortunately, he repeats the same racist ideology often quoted by Geofrey Higgins in Anacalypsis Vol 1 that the influence of spiritual systems, science, etc comes from India; however, authors like Gerald Massey, Albert Churchward, etc frankly admits without hesitation that it was the African blacks who created said spiritual system that India is credited with. In fact, in his book The Origin and Evolution of Religion by Albert Churchward, he states unequivocally it was the TWA people who created the very foundations of what we know today as Christianity, Islam, Judaism, etc. Also in his works, Gerald Massey proves beyond a doubt these religions we know today come from Africa. In addition, it was County Volney who stated thus,\"that this race of Black men, today our slave and the object of our scorn, is the very race to which we owe our arts, sciences, and even the use of speech!

            "⚠ Translation error: This book is wonderfully warm -- it's an equivalent of a really hearty meal with a couple of very friendly, supportive people that you wish were your friends. It's weird that a recipe book should make me feel so emotional, but it does. It really set the mood with its introduction of the two authors: one a native Thai woman now residing in Finland, whose dayjob is giving language lessons to those who wish to connect to their legacy by learning the language, and the other a mixed race woman who met her online, when she started learning Thai in hopes of connecting to the language of her mother. And their shared love food shines through every page, and it's second only to their love for education, because the patience and desire to share the love for traditional dishes by making them something one can understand and make at home makes this book a delightful read. I am a massive spice wimp, but I can already feel persuaded to try a few things from the book. And the art is so cute!

            "⚠ Translation error: EDIT: this review has little to do with the book. FYI. :-) I've read a number books on religion and religious commentaries and from religious authors. I feel most of what I've read have been social or cultural studies, I'm not sure I've read anything that would fall under Comparative Religious Study department. The Series 'Dimensions of Asian spirituality' is supposed to bring comparative analysis to us lay readers. So, playing a little (a lot) of catchup in this field it was good to learn some of the language and method of discourse. In this book Kasulis used Shinto as his vessel to talk about Essentialism versus Existenialism in religion. It hits on a dichotomy of religious thought that I myself have stumbled upon and I've kind of had my eyes opened a little bit. I'm not going to do the description justice, but the simplistic explanation of the conflict being between Religious Essentialism, which is you ARE religious, thus you live accordingly and Religious Existentionalism which is you live accordingly, thus you are religious. I say simplistic because those two sentences don't get to the root of the conflict and how it blooms, not just in Shinto, but clearly in all religion. Now, having read a number of books on atheism, which are, ultimately, books for atheists and not much more - which ring a bit like some religious books, written for religious people - both being basically masturbatory in tone, and neither seeing an inherit flaw in their own antithetical relationship. Mainly that, and it's almost obvious to me now, the majority of people, en masse, are religiously existential, the majority of religious advocates, writers, commentators, and defenders in general are religious essentialist - but see, they set the terminology of the discussion, as Kasulis says, 'They gloss the words, set the meaning AND the context.' So, when aethiests attack, they're often using the hegemonic devices of a minority of high profile writers and defenders and sticking it over an entire population. Hold with me here, muck like Jack London used animals to make moral statements about humankind in 'call of the wild' Kasulis as kind of shown me a more complex religious, but, now, also political landscape all by using comparative religious study on a extremely localized religion. After reading this I oddly unsettled. I have a better understanding and vocabulary for the world at large. I've had this unease which, random or not, started back with 'Occupy Wallstreet' and, I need to understand some more, but all of us, no matter your side, are railing against the wrong people. Flailing, really. Failing, ultimately. So, anyways, the book made me rethink the pollity of the entire world order. Not even intending it, I'm sure. For that, a clear 5 stars for firing off all 8 cylinders of the brain. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: This slim volume distills the profound simplicity and astonishingly refreshing elegance of \"existential\" Shinto spirituality; sustaining those attributes through a lucid and nimble demonstration of the tragic distortions, bloated philosophies and oppressive political transformations inflicted upon it by \"essentialist\" doctrine in Japan. To paraphrase and also quote Kasulis: The first chapter presents Shinto spirituality in its most general, not even necessarily Japanese form. Chapter 2 describes how Shinto is embedded culturally in contemporary Japan. Chapters 3-5 \"focus on the historical development of Shinto from prehistoric times up to the present - giving special attention to Shinto institutional, doctrinal, and political structures.\" In the final chapter, Kasulis returns us \"home\" as he says, from the wars and the burdens of history, to what might become of Shinto - how it may develop - what Shinto's history \"implies for the comparative study of religion,\" and what it teaches us about spirituality. I'm new to Shinto, having been drawn to it by a retelling of the famous myth of Amaterasu by Joseph Campbell in his Hero with a Thousand Faces. The accompanying extensive footnote in that book was compelling enough for me to investigate further and I'm very glad I found my way to Kasulis' fine scholarship. At the end of the book, Kasulis identifies within Shinto what he calls \"the two faces of nostalgia\" - the kind that is unfortunately nurtured \"to lend authority to state control,\" and another kind \"that beckons us back to a form of connectedness that has been all but erased by the rise of scientific thinking, dependence on technology, and consumerism.\" In the end, the book itself becomes a \"torii gate,\" a \"holographic entry point\" reflecting exquisite \"everyday connectedness\" and the \"kami-filled, tama-fueled\" world of existential Shinto, rescuing it deftly from its troubled middle history and present challenges. We are gently beckoned toward \"magokoro\" - the pure mindful heart - through this small treasure of a book. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: This was an interesting look at Shinto, as well as an able description of some ideas in comparative religion. It begins with a look at the spiritual core of Shinto, and explains some key concepts that I had missed in some of my other readings on the topic, which made the ideas a lot clearer. His ideas get a bit less orthodox as they go, but made an awful lot of sense to me, though I am something of an outsider, and as a Western pagan, it brought it closer to something like what I believe, which I like, but which might not be entirely accurate. The second half of the book deals more with the historical changes within Shinto, and the author's read is quite interesting, tracing some of the changes as reactions to other historical and religious ideas, and the ways that these changes are altered through different understandings. It paid particular attention to State Shinto, and some of the controversies related to Japan's time at war from the Meiji period through World War II. The final portion looks at the contrasts between the personal dimension of Shinto and the cultural effects of Shinto, and the difficulty in separating those two aspects from one another. Ultimately, I think I do understand quite a bit more about Shinto than I did when I started, though I wouldn't take this as my only source of information on the topic (and the book, itself, suggests that I seek out more information, as well, which I appreciate). --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: Speaking as a teacher to non-specialist students, there are a lot of strengths in this book. It doesn't begin in history, but with trying to connect Japanese ideas to Western concepts. The historical survey is quite deep, and answers the question about how Shinto evolved to the point of the crisis of WWII. While the book moved quickly, and it was a little more philosophically deep than I would normally assign, I was able to follow most of the aspects of the course. Some phrases, like \"holographic entry point,\" are a bit obscure. The challenge of offering a way that doesn't reject either an existentialist, emergent, non-institutional, personal spirituality or an essentialist, teaching-oriented religion is laudable. It makes for a complex argument. In making connections to the West, some of the comments about Christianity concerned me. For example, in surveying postcolonial considerations of religion, when indigenous cultures are free from Christian hegemony, he says there are two ways forward: \"resuscitating the precolonial tradition or modifying the colonial religion to include precolonial elements\" (162). A quick glance at the Black community in the US shows that this is quite a loaded reductionism. Overall, however, these moments are overwhelmed by a solid, hard text to introduce Shinto. It is a little too strong for my 2nd-year assignment for general students, but theology, philosophy, religious studies, anthropology, or Japan studies students should do fine with a little hard work. Reread in 2023 and I'm still struggling in similar ways. It is a good book for graduate-level philosophy of religion students in quite a few ways. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

Lastly, this cookbook would benefit from more careful editing. There were a few instances where a recipe headnote would contain almost exactly the same phrasing of one of the essays scattered throughout the cookbook. Furthermore, the recipe headnote for bao (from, of course, the short BAO) claims that \"the word bao translates to 'precious' or 'treasure'--which captures both the essence of the food, and the experience of crafting a meal that's meant to be shared with loved ones\". Unfortunately, the word for the food \"bao\" 包 is different from the \"bao\" 寶 they're thinking of here.

I really enjoyed reading through this one. Not only is it a cookbook, but there's a fun story you'll get to enjoy with those sneaky brownies you've come to know and maybe love from the series. The artwork is fabulous as well and brings the fun of Fablehaven to this new offering. I have to say that the names of the recipes brought back memories of the different characters from the series. When the books first came out I devoured them and then my children did as well. Fablehaven and Dragonwatch are favorites in my household. This cookbook would be a fun one to use during summertime with kids and planning fun cooking lessons/activities with them. Or fun for the Fablehaven fans who want a themed birthday party or how about a Halloween party. I think it would even be fun to use as an incentive for the struggling reader or the voracious reader as well. Finish a book and try out a few recipes then finish another book and try out a few more. Something fun to add to making reading a joy. These are the books that truly helped my own children jump into reading and love being fully engrossed in a wonderful story!

            "⚠ Translation error: Fun cookbook for fans of the Fablehaven series (which, admittedly, I have not read, ha ha, though we do have a couple of the books in our family library, so I think my kids read them)! The book begins with a new mystery-themed short story relating to the series, so it's a fun extra for fans as well. The cookbook portion is divided into the sections of Breakfast, Lunch and Snacks, Midsummer's Eve, Treats, Drinks, Brandon's Favorites, and Crafts. Each recipe includes one full-color photo with a tie-in to the characters and the stories -- sometimes a direct quote from the books, others just a short narrative explaining its origin from the characters and stories. The recipes are simple, not elaborate, so I believe this is meant to be a kids easy-to-use cookbook, as the Fablehaven series is targeted to late elementary/middle grade readers. There are very clear step-by-step instructions, and all the ingredients are very common ones that everyone should have on hand or can easily add on to your shopping list when you and your kids want to make some of the fun treats. The recipes range from treats, snacks, desserts, meals, and drinks, giving kids a wide variety of options to make food tying into their favorite Fablehaven stories. The Midsummer's Eve section contains a fruit salsa, mummy dogs, cake pops, and two more desserts. I'm assuming this section also relates to a holiday in the books, but there's not an explanation for the inclusion of this section, only for the individual recipes. Overall, the short story was enjoyable, even for me as someone who hasn't read any of the books, though there were some things I didn't understand completely, which I'm sure other readers of the series would understand better. The recipes are fun. The pictures are well done. The book has a great graphic design overall, including pencil/black-and-white/charcoal drawings of some of the Fablehaven fairies and other creatures in the story section and also throughout the rest of the book on some of the recipe pages. This is a great youth and family cookbook, but I think it would also be great for teachers to incorporate into using the recipes and their curriculum relating to this fun fantasy series! ***I received a digital copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for my honest review.*** --> No translation was found using the current translator.

The sections include; Breakfast, Lumch and Snacks, Midsummer’s Eve, Treats, Brandon’s Favorites ending with some crafts. The directions are clear but while some are easy like pancakes or using a cake mix with add ins to make Zombie Cake Eyeballs others are more complex. And although there are healthy things like Tomato Soup or hummus most of the recipes are on the sweeter side. I love that each recipe has an accompanying color photo. You don’t have to be a Fablehaven fan to use the cookbook. I can see many of the recipes being used for themed parties. Fablehaven books are geared towards upper elementary school and middle-schoolers. And I’m sure that age group would love to assist in making some of these fun recipes.

Written in a down to earth every person prose, the stories, the suggestions, the works, prayers are all highly accessible and easily explained. This of course makes one confident to move forward without fear of judgment. It makes you wonder what our community and society would look like today without the Maafa. There was so much of our ways that were lost or suppressed by our embrace of Christianity and Islam. Some of the ancient ways were syncretized into these religions but most of the ways and lore under those banners is often unrecognizable. So this book does a great job in exposing the way our Ancestors moved in the world, how ritual worked in their lives and relying on nature healed people and situations. I found much that i can put to use as I’m always attempting to deepen my bond with ancestors known and unknown, so for me this is a 5☀️ book in my humble opinion. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: Bake It Off is a delightful and cleverly crafted baking cookbook inspired by the music, personality, and ever-evolving eras of Taylor Swift. With over 50 recipes spanning everything from breakfast bites to sweet midnight snacks, each dish is paired with curated playlists, fun Easter eggs, and playful nods to Taylor’s lyrics, albums, and iconic moments. Whether you're a lifelong fan from her country roots or a newly minted Midnights devotee, there’s something delicious in here for every Swiftie. I thought this was such a cute, creative, and super catchy concept. The way Lindsey Smith weaves Taylor’s world into each recipe, from the cheeky names to the ingredients and styling, makes flipping through this book a joy. I tried the Chai Cookies right away (inspired by Taylor’s own recipe), and not only did they turn out perfectly, but they also filled my kitchen with the warm, cozy scent of cinnamon and cardamom. It really captures the spirit of the fandom in such a fun and accessible way. The dazzling food photography, thoughtful gluten-free and vegan options, and whimsical touches like “Victory Pop(star) Tarts” and “So Scarlet, It Was Macaron” show how much care and love went into making this a true celebration of Taylor and her fans. I have several Swifties in my life who are going to adore this, and I’ll definitely be grabbing a few copies as gifts.

            "⚠ Translation error: Simone Weil’s Waiting for God was a Christmas gift for me in 2013, but one I received in time for Advent. As any serious reader knows, when one encounters a significant book/author—much like when you meet the right person—can be almost as important as the book itself. Waiting for God is an unlikely but apt Advent read. It is improbable in the sense Weil lived a more vibrant Christianity than most who claim to be ardent members of any known Christian denomination and yet she stopped short of receiving the sacrament of Baptism. It is pertinent as in the first word of the title; ‘waiting’ is a function of Advent. As the ‘arrival of something anticipated’, the Christian liturgical season of Advent is necessarily a waiting time. Weil was by nature as well as choice a lifelong wait-er. She was waiting literately on God, on His guidance and His instructions as she perceived them. This is a difficult concept for most of us to grasp. We get up in the morning and do what we’ve always done, what’s required by the day’s schedule or for those without benefit of discipline, whatever strikes the fancy. For the rest, if the routine varies it’s usually due to input from others, circumstances beyond our control such as accidents, emergencies, and other major events, good and bad, major or minor. Weil’s approach to life and the writing she shares in this book is completely different. First of all, there’s intensity to everything she says and does. It’s as if she can never forget, not even for a second, the temporary nature of our earthly existence. She’s in a race with time and while you are with her so are you. And yet, at the same time, she is deeply contemplative. Nothing is superficial or insignificant to/or about her. She’s completely real and yet an enigma because as she continues to learn and grow, she constantly changes. I could sense these things about her in my reading but it was so intuitive that as I would go back over what I’d just covered, I’d often find it almost impossible to put my finger on exactly what it was that led me to these conclusions. Also, I felt protective of her. Perhaps I am wrong in this, but I found myself reluctant to share her writings with certain individuals who would dismiss her ideas outright simply because of her choices, especially her choice not to be baptized. Or maybe what I mean is that I lament my own inability to defend her choices because although instinctively I agree with her, I don’t understand her writings well enough to defend her against critics. And I couldn't bear the thought of her being criticized. Let them make fun of or insult me, but not her. Waiting for God is a collection of writings which are only loosely related. There are her six letters to Father Perrin, apparently a devout priest, friend and spiritual confidant who she entrusts with her reasons for loving yet refusing to join the Church. These all-too brief letters read like the most unusual and deeply moving love story I can imagine. Sometimes the situation reminded me of an arranged marriage between God and Simone, where she was only waiting to hear her dearly Beloved tell her He loved her and that would be enough for her to go ahead (with Baptism). Other times I had the feeling she really saw herself as God’s Missionary to those outside organized religion. Either way, she was content to be what He wanted her to be, because she belonged to Him and Him alone. The second part of the book is a collection of essays. These left me spellbound and changed me at every encounter. At some point in time I want to go back and try to summarize my notes on them—but after I have had some time to let the ideas Weil proposed gestate. As I was reading these essays, I would read for a while, then pause, reflect, pray or jot something in the margins or highlight a section. If pressed to say which was my favorite essay I would reluctantly choose Forms of the Implicit Love of God looking back wistfully at Concerning the Our Father , only because the former contained so many divine (no pun intended) mini-essays. I am thoroughly frustrated with this review, but then I know I would be disappointed with anything I could write about Weil’s work. But eventually I have to finish it and let it go. As to the book, well this is just an introductory read. God willing, I’ll be back!

            "⚠ Translation error: After reading her books, you have to ask, is Simone Weil a saint or is she crazy? After all, when she was ill with pneumonia, she allowed herself to eat just the amount she thought would be available to residents of German occupied France in the early 1940s – and starved herself at age 34. Why should we read Weil? Susan Sontag tells us we often measure truth in terms of the suffering of the author. Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Kafka, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Genet—and Simone Weil have their authority with us partly because of their conviction, their self-martyrdom. Modern readers could not embrace the life choices or ideas of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, but ‘we read them for their scathing originality, for their personal authority, for the example of their seriousness, and for their willingness to sacrifice themselves for their truths.’ Simone Weil belongs in this category, ‘one of the most uncompromising and troubling witnesses to the modern travail of the spirit.’ Simone Weil was born into a family of wealthy, intellectual, secular Parisian Jews. In her early twenties she had a spiritual birth when in a Portuguese village she heard the wives of fishermen singing religious hymns. She felt Christianity was the true religion of the oppressed. Later she was moved by a chapel where St. Frances served, and by poem from Herbert. Although she accepted Jesus as truth and beauty, she would never be baptized because she believed the same truth and beauty existed in the Greek philosophers, in Taoism, in Buddhism, in the Bhagavad-Gita and in ancient Egypt. She also believed ‘The Church has borne too many evil fruits for there not to have been some mistake at the beginning. Europe has been spiritually uprooted, cut off from that antiquity in which all the elements of our civilization have their origin. . . It would be strange, indeed, that the word of Christ should have produced such results if it had been properly understood.’ She was also appalled by what organized religion could do when it became powerful, citing the Catholic Church’s record of the crusades, banning, and inquisition. She was similarly suspicious of Protestantism, which she felt to be too closely linked with individual nations. Plus, she felt too many parishioners assign importance to the rituals instead of striving to attain a personal understanding with God. Weil saw Jesus as the perfect model of suffering. Weil believed that God's love becomes born or personified in us when we pay attention to others. This requires emptying ourselves of our own our interests and projections in order to be truly present to another person – similar to the kenosis of the early Gnostics. She left her position as a philosophy professor where she was constantly in trouble with school administrators because of her involvement with the unemployed, her participation in labor protests and her difficulty dealing with authority. She worked in an auto factory, then in the fields working a farm. Simone Weil tells us that the first principle of helping another is not action. It is to see and respect the other. She repeatedly notes that the greater the suffering of the other person, the harder it is truly to see and hear that person. Weil reminds us how glibly we can talk about compassion, as if it were an easy thing, sometimes making it sound like little more than pity. However, true compassion requires us to allow suffering to disturb us and even sometimes to take us over. Weil wrote ‘There should not be the slightest discrepancy between one's thoughts and one's way of life.’ Sontag responds that sanity requires some compromising, some evasions and even lies. Maybe that why Weil’s relentless searching makes us uncomfortable. T.S. Eliot wrote ‘A potential saint can be a very difficult person. One is struck, here and there, by contrast between (Weil’s) almost superhuman humility and what appears to be an almost outrageous arrogance.’ Kenneth Rexroth wrote ‘Simone Weil was one of the most remarkable women of the twentieth, or indeed of any other century. She could interject all the ill of the world into her own heart. . . Her letters read like the more distraught signals of John of the Cross in the dark night.’ Pope Paul VI (who corresponded with Weil and tried to get her baptized) said that Weil was one of his three greatest influences, and Albert Camus said ‘Weil was the only great spirit of our time.’ I believe Sontag, Eliot and Rexroth are right.

            "⚠ Translation error: The Truth: I have given it five stars and I have included it in my 'favorites' shelf and surely I will add her to the list of my favourite authors. The truth is I have read only this book and even in this book I have not understood many of the passages. Let me explain or at least try to explain. Simone Weil: The Person: There was a short biographical sketch at the end of this book. It was really short and yet it was a life story that moved me. She was born in France in 1909 and she died in 1943. She had a short life. She was a student of philosophy and studied along with Simone de Beauvoir. She was attracted to both Marxism and Catholicism. She was blessed with lot of mystical visions (A leftist mystic !). She was attracted to Catholicism and interestingly she never became a Catholic. For becoming a Catholic would mean that she will be excluded from the groups that are in opposition to the Church. She wanted to be a member of the universal humanity. She did not want herself excluded from any group and that would have been her greatest suffering. She took a voluntary annual leave from her teaching job to become an ordinary factory worker and lived in the condition a factory worker lived. She was convinced that to know the struggles of a factory worker one needs to be a factory worker. She gave up extra rations (though it was advised to her by the doctors) and ate what was permissible to the French soldiers in the occupied France during the Second World War. As soon as she heard of a famine in China she could not contain herself - she wept for them. Her Writings: The book contains six letters that she wrote to a Catholic priest regarding her reason why she did not want to enter into the Catholic Church and there are three essays and a reflection on the Lord's Prayer. On these I am not sure how to make my review...... It is better that I let Weil speak her mind. 1. Her reason for not entering the Church: \"What frightens me is the Church as a social structure.....I feel that it is necessary and ordained that I should be alone, a stranger and an exile in relation to every human circle without exception.....To be lost to view in it is not to form part of it, and my capacity to mix with all of them implies that I belong to none.\" In another place she writes: \"The love of those things that are outside visible Christianity keeps me outside the Church.\" 2. On the Way to reach Salvation: \"....desire directed toward God is the only power capable of raising the soul. Or rather, it is God alone who comes down and possesses the soul, but desire alone draws God down.\" She advocates that the most important part a soul can do to reach God is to wait with its complete attention turned towards God. She writes: \"We do not obtain the most precious gifts by going in search of them but by waiting for them.\" In another place she writes: \"The infinity of space and time separates us from God. How are we to seek for him? How are we to go toward him? Even if we were to walk for hundreds of years, we should do no more than go round and round the world.....We are incapable of progressing vertically. We cannot take a step toward the heavens. God crosses the universe and comes to us.\" In another place she writes:\"One of the principal truths of Christianity, a truth that goes almost unrecognized today, is that looking is what saves us...To long for God and to renounce all the rest, that alone can save us....Seeking leads us astray.......This waiting for goodness and truth is, however, something more intense than any searching.\" How such attention is possible? She has an interesting reflection on school education that aids in preparing us in such process. To be fully attentive in dealing with a mathematical sum or to be attentive in dealing with the grammatical nuances in Latin is in fact a preparation for a person to have a complete attention only on one Being in his later stage. She writes: \"Every school exercise, thought of in this way, is like a sacrament.\" 3. Biblical Reflections: There are some Biblical passages that get reflected upon by Simone Weil and they are superb. Some examples:\"It is true that we have to love our neighbor, but, in the example that Christ gave as an illustration of this commandment, the neighbor is a being of whom nothing is known, lying naked, bleeding, and unconscious on the road. It is a question of completely anonymous, and for that reason, completely universal love.\" \"Christ did not however prescribe the abolition of --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: A few years ago I encountered Weil and she had an immense effect on me. I try and revisit her periodically and am still very far from coming to any definite views on her life and thought. If she were fictional she'd probably be the greatest literary character of the twentieth century. The fact that she literally existed is endlessly haunting and strange. I go back and forth about whether she was serious philosopher. Her thought is violent and often shudders on the verge of utter incoherence. At the same time, real wisdom is apparent in almost every line. It's possible to read this book as a confession of madness - as no doubt modern psychiatrists would have a field day diagnosing Weil and giving her drugs; all the same I think she ultimately resists any efforts to dismiss her or explain her away. Weil emphatically agrees with Nietzsche that Christianity is a religion for slaves. From there the two of them went in radically different directions. Reading Nietzsche one gets the impression he's frantically trying to convince himself he's not a slave; Weil came to accept the truth of Christianity after recognizing herself as one. Where Nietzsche would hysterically assert his own freedom and strength, Weil's self-loathing at times borders on a kind of megalomania. I appreciate Nietzsche but find his rants tiresome at times. The absolute need to be an individual can lead to a lot of romantic clichés. By contrast, Weil's intense focus on what is anonymous, impersonal, uncreated in herself results in a stunningly unique self-portrait. * It's clear Weil was not opposed to food itself, only the act of eating; somehow she knew that was not part of her earthly vocation The relation of hunger to food is far less complete, to be sure, but just as real as is that of the act of eating. It is perhaps not inconceivable that in a being with certain natural propensities, a particular temperament, a given past, a certain vocation, and so on, the desire for and deprivation of the sacraments might constitute a contact more pure than actual participation. She'd always justify her extreme asceticism in terms of a need to mingle with all of humanity. Even after coming to believe the Gospel, she refused herself the comfort of entering the Church on the grounds that it was not truly universal. She did not want to limit herself in any way or exclude non-Christians from her understanding. Her final self-starvation was meant as an act of solidarity. She literally could not live with herself being separate from the masses suffering through war. * \"Friendship is a miracle by which a person consents to view from a certain distance, and without coming any nearer, the very being who is necessary to him as food.\" \"It is impossible for two human beings to be one while scrupulously respecting the distance that separates them, unless God is present in each of them. The point at which parallels meet is infinity.\" * For future study: compare Weil's 'affliction' ( malheur ) to Paul Ricoeur on the servile will, the involuntary at the heart of freedom. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: How does one offer an opinion much less a critique of a \"classic\" book? A number of my mentors, thoughtful friends, and respected teachers have noted Simon Weil's influence and have urged me to read her essays--but I resisted. I confess now my reluctance sprang from suspicion, an unfounded suspicion as it turns out that Simone Weil was simply another spiritual fad. It was the admonition by a respected friend to not buy the book unless I was prepared to be seriously challenged that, of course, was bait needed to spur this \"contrarian\" into a purchase. Warren Farha, the wise owner of Eighth Day Books, smiled as he handed me \"Waiting for God\" and said, \"an all-time read.\" And so it was. My first reading occurred during a long day of air travel. This long and uninterrupted time to read was fortuitous. This is a book reading that cannot be digested quickly, needs frequent review and pondering of sentences and paragraphs, and does not tolerate interruption. The irony of reading a starving young aesthetic's painful and honest thoughts about wholly loving God while cruising at 30,000 feet was not lost, Weil's thoughts about beauty seemed prophetic as we flew over the Rockies at sunset. \"The love we feel for the splendor of the heavens, the plains, the sea, and the mountains, for the silence of nature which is borne in upon us by thousands of tiny sounds, for the breath of the winds or the warmth of the sun, this love of which every human being has at least and inkling, is an incomplete, painful love, because it is felt for things incapable of responding, . . . Men want to turn this same love toward a being who is like themselves and capable of answering to their love, of saying yes, of surrendering. . . . The longing to love the beauty of the world in a human being is essentially the longing for the Incarnation. . . .The Incarnation alone can satisfy it.\" As a teacher, I think the essay \"Reflections on the Right Use of School Studies with a View to the Love of God\" should be required reading for all students and teachers. However, be forewarned. Weil would not be a fan of \"No child left behind\" or for that matter, much else on our contemporary educational scene. For instance these politically incorrect words, \"Quite apart from explicit religious belief, every time that a human being succeeds in making an effort of attention with the sole idea of increasing his grasp of truth, he acquires a greater aptitude for grasping it, even if his effort produces no visible fruit.\" Weil was no Thomas Dewey-oid utilitarian educator. Weil is much quoted but I suspect like many thoughtful writers exploring difficult topics is less often read. In addition, to quote her thoughts on education or art without including her clear call for expanded compassion and service and suffering is to misconstrue by omission. Her prose is of an old fashioned and slightly inhospitable academic style, an odd combination of rigorous philosophic rationalism combined with an unapologetic mystical sensibility. Perhaps, some of the lumpy sentences would become more lyrical if read in the original French To be clear, I view this review as a first pass on Weil's thought. I hold my first two readings of \"Waiting for God\" as insufficient to understand all of what this thin volume holds. Yet, there is a thick and compelling force in Weil's words, a wisdom beyond what is possible to say and a palpable presence encrusting her printed words. Weil does not treat easy subjects and offers no pat \"bullet-point\" answers. The faith she describes speaks of suffering more than certainty and acts of contrition rather than acts of assertion. Like Flannery O'Connor, Weil the artist \"uses[her] reason to discover an answering reason in everything [she] sees. . . to find [truth] in the object, in the situation, in the sequence.\" Weil treats her words as art rather than utility. And as she points out, \"Every true artist has had real, direct, and immediate contact with the beauty of the world, contact that is of the nature of a sacrament.\" Sacraments are visible rites that signify and make present the grace of God. How like the God who favored children, the dispossessed, and the lowly to use a young woman's words in the midst of war as a vehicle for grace. A woman who had virtually no impact while alive and did not feel worthy to partake of God's sacraments has become the means by which others, and I am in that number, have found a far richer and larger available stock of reality. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: This was my first direct encounter with Weil's writing after hearing about her for years. I was struck by her intellectual commitment, her brilliance, and her kookiness. But there's a lot of great stuff here. The essay on school studies and attention is the best of the lot. \"The love of our neighbour in all its fullness simply means being able to say to him: 'What are you going through?' It is a recognition that the sufferer exists, not only as a unit in a collection, or a specimen from a social category labelled 'unfortunate,' but as a man, exactly like we are, who was one day stamped with a special mark by afflication. For this reason it is enough, but it is indispensable, to know how to look at him in a certain way. This way of looking is first of all attentive. The soul empties itself of all its own contents in order to receive into itself the being it is looking at, just as he is, in all his truth. Only he who is capable of attention can do this. So it comes about that, paradoxical as it may seem, a Latin prose or a geometry problem, even though they are done wrong, may be of great service one day, provided we devote the right kind of effort to them. Should the occasion arise, they can one day make us better able to give someone in affliction exactly the help required to save him, at the supreme moment of his need.\" The stressed out, struggling, and striving students in higher ed today would benefit from this.

One reason for that is the very justifiable one of relocating, something I am still in the midst of with my kitchen and my Internet set up while my clothes and my books are very much otherwise. The other is what I honestly expected to be confronted with as soon as I made up my mind to acquire a copy of this: the deep and long enduring incompatibility between me and Christianity, Catholicism in particular. Now, if there's something I've learned upon entering into my fourth decade, any facet of personality is worth probing to see whether the trait is something well earned or whether it could use some complication through the introduction of well crafted material. So, when it came to this particular subject, I looked at my far from straightforward, yet extremely fruitful relationship with Simone Weil, observed how frequently this particular piece of hers showed up in comparison to her far more unorthodox writings, and thought, if I was going to test my limits, I might as well test it with her. Now that I have, I see that, while she certainly says things that go along with my most fervent beliefs, mine come from a grounding in human biology, sociopolitical history, and modern day movements focused on generating equity and mutual aid, while hers are...well. Let's just say I have a better understanding of where Foucault was coming from and what is currently looking to set the rights of people with uteruses in my country back half a century. There's some bits and bobs that are worth taking into consideration in the long run, but for the most part, I just don't jive with a text that starts off with a critique of totalitarianism and then turns around to say oh but this one is different , and I never will. Reading is inherently an experience of the crossroads, but the intersection of the words of the author and the intent of the publisher is still noticeably laughably peculiar in the case of this piece. The biographical note makes do with what it can, but the introduction is so bogged down with its selling point that it goes as far as to call Weil a martyr, and having gone so far as to take a university course on the hagiographies of female saints, my taken aback scrutiny is grounded in more than my personal biases on the matter. I had hopes when Weil's own words finally came in on scene in the form of letters that she wrote to a sympathetic priest, and the measured critiques and fervent compassion that I've come to expect from her made such positive assumptions seem justified. However, certain, dare I say it, bourgeoisie tendencies coupled to the more proselytizing/thoughtcrime aspects of Catholicism started creeping in as soon as the writing switched from letters to essays, and it became increasingly hard to care when everything was yoked to a One True Message and Weil proclaimed that the solution to habitus wasn't equitability, but to make everything Christocentric, as if there wasn't enough rabid evangelism poisoning social systems the world over these days. It's a strange thing, for while Weil's actions correspond a great deal with my own initiatives, she requires reality to be filtered through a specific lens that everything and everyone must conform to for the sake of a better humanity, while I view multiplicity as an inevitability of the world till now and don't throw up my hands simply because we're all going to die one of these days. A good lesson in cause and effect when it comes to motivation and action of those I may sympathize with but who in turn would, due to their world-grounding ideologies, would gladly see me dead, but nothing in the way of a conversion. For all that above, I'm still very interested in reading more of Weil. It's a matter of acknowledging complexities while delving into the facets more relevant to my interests, and while I have rather tempered expectations of Weil's writings on colonialism after having read this, I still feel that such a perspective is extremely valuable, if not necessary, to my own intellectual pursuits. Of course, good luck finding a copy that is priced similar to that of her Christianity adjoined writings, but with the upheaval of my life starting to settle down, I can start having thoughts on what the far more stable financial situation, which remains barely believable even while having qualified me for the apartment I now compose this piece within, will mean for my book acquiring habits.

            "⚠ Translation error: In some ways, this book is not for me. I currently have the next 7 weeks of meals written on the calendar and recently made 14 meals ahead of time for the freezer for those all too frequent evenings when I just can't get it together. I never feel inferior (or judgemental!) when I see other people's kitchens and fridges as McCord suggests in the beginning of the book. But I love organization, cooking, and streamlining my processes to make things simpler. Deciding what foods to prepare for breakfast, lunch, and dinner is the single hardest regular homemaking decision I make...again and again and again. Parts of this book were just review for me as I have been heavily involved in the kitchen for 20 years now, but the tips might help those with little guidance or experience. I generally know where to store equipment and food items in a way that works for me, but it takes a while to learn. What I really loved about this book was the recipes. They are well-organized, very customizable, and simple to follow. Some books/websites for what I pejoratively call \"mom cooking\" consist of shortcuts like 75 ways to use a rotisserie chicken, or lots of recipes opening cans into a crockpot, or recipes that can be made all on one sheet pan or pot. There IS a place for that, but lowering my time spent in the kitchen is not my main kitchen goal. Other cookbooks I dislike are all about health fads, or sneaking kale into brownies for my kids, or the recipes have unusual ingredients I may never use again. I just want to eat yummy food that doesn't take a professional chef's expertise to make. This cookbook is one of those books. And it had the added bonus of tips to make ahead of time, tips to store for later, and a beautiful 4 week meal plan with prep instructions. I will probably purchase this book. As much as I bragged in the beginning of this review, I do get into awful ruts in my meal planning and prep. (I'm just coming out of an 8 month long slump.) It's hard to be consistent. I always appreciate achievable goals and a little inspiration. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: I'm not done with the book, but I am also reading the associated book, The Plant Paradox, and am mostly through it. To those arguing against the book, if you will take the time to read the original book and absorb the information, you should understand that it makes complete sense; though I acknowledge that if you are not having continual gut issues, there is very little reason for you to give the book any attention whatsoever. However, Dr. Gundry is quite clear with his explanations and provides a lot of evidence for his assertions. He is not saying everyone should give up every food with lectins. In fact, this book is not for everyone. Most people will benefit from the knowledge in this book, but the ones who will get the most out of it are ones who either struggle with one or more chronic illnesses or have tried every other diet and still struggled with weight issues. The fact of the matter is that most of us are so ingrained on our \"normal\" eating habits, that we cannot stomach such a drastic change in diet for a marginal change in health, but to those with serious health issues that conventional medicine only ignores or makes worse, this book is a Godsend. My wife and I have experimented with the foods on his okay list and his \"say no\" list and we have found a correlation with our energy levels and well-being. It gives us the power of understanding which we can leverage to modulate our diet to get the effects we need. I've known instinctually/experientially about the effects of some of these foods for years (particularly pepper and tomato skins), and had already found some of his answers on my own, but this book gives a more complete picture of what I sketched out haphazardly. The six-week first phase Gundry suggests is not for people to get used to the diet necessarily, but for a suffering person to get the most dramatic and immediate results, so that he or she can clearly see the principles in operation and get relief. Then after that 6 weeks, you can start adding back some of your favorites to see what causes issues. Some things, some of us will clearly never give up. And you don't have to use his recipes, but they are a decent inspiration--you can take his principles and adjust some of your favorites to reduce your lectin load. For instance, if you love tomatoes, you don't have to abstain--simply make sure you peel and seed them from now on if they cause you issues. If you love beans, just be sure to prepare them properly. Having said all of that, some of these recipes seem to need work or more (any?) time in the test kitchen. The ginger brownie bites to me tasted like a mix between compost and vomit, which surprised me, because I like all of the ingredients in the recipe--it was definitely a negative sum of all of its parts. But...once you go completely without sugar for a while, even as unenjoyable as these crumbly garden soil sandcastle-like \"brownie bites\" still are, they do bring a slight amount of enjoyment/comfort when you're tweaking. I give them a 2 out of 10. The sweet potato spaghetti and meatballs was a disaster for me, and I'm not exactly a beginner in the kitchen. From the picture, I was pretty intrigued and expected something at least edible. On closer inspection, I had several issues with the recipe, but decided to make it just as instructed to give it a chance. I give it a 1 out of 10. SO bad. It was a tragic waste of the wonderful pesto recipe included in the book. If I had made any of the changes my instincts told me to, it may have been edible. On the opposite end of the spectrum, recipes such as the cauliflower fritters (9 out of 10) and the cassava tortillas (7 out of 10) are amazing. The cassava tortillas are almost a perfect replacement for wheat flour tortillas, but they are strange in that they are very fragile during pressing and cooking, but are super-tough once done and a lot harder to bite into--still, they are very worth the effort. Also satisfactory and satisfying were the beef and mushroom stew (6+ out of 10) and the eggroll in a bowl (7 out of 10). I look forward to many of the other recipes and will edit this review with a concise summary once we get most or all of the book under our belt. I'm only giving it 3 out of 5 based on how bad those two recipes were since this IS a cookbook after all, but I recognize it's not fair not having tried all of the recipes and will update that rating appropriately. I rate the original book much higher. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

I haven't finished William's book yet, but I'm already amazed at how these two disagree. Two items off the top of my head: Gundry advises to avoid fruit while Williams touts it as a requirement for the liver; Gundry is enthusiastic about egg yolks (eat up to four a day!) while Williams sees them as feeding the viral explosion that is ravaging our bodies. I think Williams (since I'm reviewing his book here) is guilty of taking bits of information and extrapolating to compose a seemingly logical way of eating that will save you from health problems. But I just don't believe it. Especially since I did a tiny amount of research on the web just to check it out. It's tempting to sign on to a program such as either of these, especially if you're feeling desperate about a health issue. But, SCIENCE, people!

            "⚠ Translation error: Had this tome been half as long it might have been twice as good. The ten \"metaphors\" of the title -- more properly Fox's take on Jungian archetypes--can't be sustained without a good deal of rhetorical padding, quote-mining, repetition, and generally ginning up arguments out of some thin spiritual and sociological ground. I suspect that ten, being perceived as a \"masculine\" number (in contrast the the \"feminine\" 3 x 3=9) became Fox's target as he set down to write this book. Ironically, then, in a critique of the purported patriarchal need to dominate the feminine, he numerically dominates the feminine. The result is a bloated assemblage of related ideas that overlap but never quite coalesce. Too often, what might have been a valid insight into some aspect of western culture sinks under grab-bag of gratuitous references and out-of-context quotes by authors famous and otherwise. The short quotes degenerate into mere decoration, and the longer ones are too often too long. All fall into the same anodyne writing style. And lists, many lists, as if a weak argument is bolstered by a recitation of authors who said something kinda-sorta like that. Though quoting broadly from world-wide spiritual traditions, Fox never gets past his own white, male, Roman Catholic perspective. Honor and shame are the underlying concern of the early chapters. (Raised as I was in the Protestant tradition, fixation on the honor-shame continuum seem rather quaint; humiliation is what keeps me up nights.) Later chapters, attempting to meld current discourses on matriarchy and patriarchy, are informative but hardly groundbreaking. Some \"insights\" are quite banal: Young people are not entering nursing due to a cultural shift toward healing professions, health care is where the jobs are. As other reviewers have noted, the work at times feels like an academic exercise. Five pages worth of discussion are too often stretched to 20 or more -- likely in the service of that patriarchal task-master, ego. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

But a lot of the foods would take a while to prepare, and are kind of advanced, even for middle-schoolers. Unless your kids are ready for MasterChef Kids, you are probably going to have to be kind of involved here. And the recipes are generally not weeknight friendly. I would give this, and encourage parents of budding chefs and foodies to check this out. The book is very friendly in tone, and got my kids excited to try some different things. And that alone is worth the time it took to track down. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",
            " On the plus side, this cookbook contains a really wide variety of cuisines and recipes (leaning heavily vegetarian). There are 12 countries, and at least 3 recipes from each country. How often do you find Morocco and Japan in the same cookbook? I suspect this book would encourage kids to try new things. However, the recipes lack some detail. For example, we made zaalouk with halloumi from the Morocco section. It says to cube an eggplant - but doesn't say what size eggplant to start with, or what size cubes to cut. We cut the eggplant fairly small but it still didn't seem fully cooked at the end of the time specified in the recipe. Given that this is aimed at young, possibly inexperienced cooks, I expected more detail and attention in the text of the recipes. (I also found the writing style a trifle over-the-top enthusiastic - it feels like every other experience or dish was the \"best ever\". But I suppose if that contributes to getting kids enthusiastic about exploring cuisines, it has served its purpose.) So 4 or 5 stars for variety, 3 to 4 for recipe details, and only 3 stars for the supporting text.

It was nostalgic to read about some of the herbal remedies that were a staple in my household that I forgot about, as well as learn about new herbs that I have never heard of and the ways to use them. I enjoyed learning about different tribes of people and their culture, different ways to access spirituality, as well as different terms and practices that spread across the African diaspora. I believe this book is very beginner friendly to anybody within the African diaspora that wants a short yet informative read on history, remedies, and various cultural practices. I did come into this book with the expectation that I would read about some of the traditions we subconsciously perform today and how they relate back to the superstitions and practices in the motherland and was slightly disappointed, but I do understand that it would've been challenging to cover it, especially if we were to talk about every single diasporic group.

Again, saw every game and there was no question the Lakers were going to win it all... no one was even close. So who does Simmons rank higher: the 89 Pistons (please!!!); 87 Lakers (I agree that team is in the running) the 96 Bulls (despite their W-L record, I believe they are a bit overrated, but yes I will acknowledge they are certainly in the top 5; and... wait for it... the 1986 Celtics. C'mon... really... seriously??? Simmons actually says that the 86 celtics would have \"swollowed up\" the 2001 lakers. Only in Simmon's dreams. First off, I think the 87 Lakers were better, and so were the 96 bulls. So, as you can see, I had some problems. And I focused on these problems in this review... but it takes nothing away from what Bill Simmons achieved with this book (which I certainly hope he continues to update like Bill James once did with the Baseball Abstract). In fact this book is hands down the best book ever written on capturing the sport's greatness, and all over newcomers will probably be compared to this as the first and final test. This book was so insightful... that the last year Phil Jackson coached the Lakers he handed out a few copies to chosen players he knew were hoping to be students of the game. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: 3.5 stars This story jumped out at me because it wasn't just about the hot college football player. Both MCs were athletes with strong personalities and huge talent. This was different enough to intrigue me and give it a go. The heroine was the hottest softball player on campus and something of a legend herself. She's Sexy Lexi-the ball player that holds all the records, lives her life to play and excel, but has no social life to speak of. She's independent, self-reliant, and beautiful. This is her senior year though, and she's decided to take it a little easier and try to enjoy herself a little more. Go to a few parties and meet some new people. Her two best friends are on a mission to make this happen. She's been a hopeless hermit and they are determined to help her live a little before she graduates. Jake is cocky, and your typical college \"golden boy\" who has women handed to him on a golden platter.(And pretty much anything else he wants.) In some ways they are so similar: top athletes, sexy, competitive, stubborn and over-achievers. BUT...when these two meet they're like vinegar and water. They are both stunned and feel an immediate attraction upon running into each other at a party but that's as far as Lexi is concerned, that's where it ends. (To his shock and dismay) Her issues? 1. He's a slut 2. He's spoiled and cocky 3. He's rubs her the wrong way from the first word out of his mouth 4. He's a slut.....oh yeah. Said that. Well, it bears repeating Unbeknownst by her, he is actually tired of the meaningless, one time hook-ups, constant parties and fake clinger-ons always surrounding him. He wants to get more serious about his grades and prepare himself if his dreams of the NFL don't pan out. When he meets Lexi, he wants her like he's never wanted anyone before, but his past reputation is coming back to haunt him. Lexi makes him work HARD for every little piece of her-he has to WIN their first date with her by challenging her to a competition in the gym. She's not impressed with his status or smooth moves. I have to say, that was one of my favorite things about the book. She doesn't fall in his lap and he immediately sees her worth and value. This book had a lot going for it. There was a lot I really enjoyed, the double athlete angle, their interesting personalities, and the side story of Lexi's two best friends. It was interesting and engaging and the pace kept moving at a steady flow. That being said, Lexi and Jake's relationship evolved to a very volatile, codependent and I-love-you-I-hate-you kind of feel. Lexi started becoming that annoying girl. You know, that girl that had everything going for her and after becoming one half of the \"perfect\"couple and loses her identity. She's now revolving around \"her man\" and everything begins and ends with him. I would say this is the main conflict of the story and when the plot started to sway this way, I started to lose my patience and my urge to skim started to rise. I understood where the author was coming from, and it's perfectly plausible for this to happen with the \"golden couple\" on campus, but for me, it caused my opinion of Lexi to plummet. I'm not a fan of this in heroines and it made me want to smack her. Luckily, she finally did see the light and regain her sense of self and that's what saved the book for me. Their hot and cold emotional dynamic was a bit immature for me. I would've liked for them to have less screaming matches and make-up sex but hey, the sex was hot, so I'm not gonna complain much. If you're a fan of NA college romance, athletes, and an easy, fast flowing read this might be the book for you. My pet peeves may not be yours and this could be a hit out of the ball park for you. I will say when the next in the series comes out about Lexi's BFFs, I will most likely be giving it a shot as well. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: What can I say about this book? Well, right away I was excited to start reading this book. But as I got into the first few chapters, I almost quit. And I hate not reading an entire book! What threw me was how rude and mean Lexi, the main female character, was. I can understand how her focus and determination on athletics would make her not want to be distracted by a guy, especially a smokin-hot QB like Jake. But come on...she was an absolute witch to him, would not even let him talk for 5 minutes. And then Jake was a complete puppy dog around her. He should have walked away and never spoken to Lexi again. She was my least favorite character from the book, which is a very rare occurrence for me. But I kept on reading cause I thought it couldn't get any worse. And it didn't, just the opposite. The relationship between Jake and Lexi was so up and down, I was getting a little upset. But that's good that a book can pull you in emotionally, feeling involved with the story. All through the book, Lexi became two completely different people. The independent-don't-take-crap-from-no one Lexi, and the selfless-do-whatever-he-wants-done Lexi. But towards the end of the book, I couldn't stand her again, reverting back to the mean Lexi. I wouldn't have blamed Jake for totally giving up on her and moving on, I was actually expecting it. But a HEA always seemed to be where this book was headed, even though personally I wish it didn't. I think Jake was too good for Lexi in the end and should have booted her to the curb for how she treated him. But he had his flaws too: man-whore past, overprotective, borderline controlling, but completely whipped at the same time. I guess I was hoping the characters would've had different interactions with each other. Lexi went from completely hating his guts one day, to being flirty and really liking Jake literally the next day. And all the relationship seemed like was either fighting or sex. No actually romance, downtime, order in/hang out and watch tv scenes to even see why they loved each other. I'm really debating whether or not to read the next book in the series...but I probably will since series books are my favorite. This review is completely written in my opinion and just hope it helps anyone with deciding to read it.

Lexi I'm sorry is damn awful. Her character was so interesting at the start, fiesty but independent she just went into a bunny boiler. Looking at a naked woman is cheating? Like shite. Maybe its not something you like your partner doing but looking is not cheating. Sorry but thats some controlling behaviour and thats a red flag. Also the fights? Does anybody want to read a romance where they fight constantly. One fight scene fine, fights happen but it just felt like they were having screaming matches all the time and I didn't like either of them for it. Lexi also was just so pathetic. Spent all week ignoring him instead of saying my mum is here and I need to look after her or something. Jake was terrible too. Her not telling her family about him hurt but surely you'd see why she didn't? That made no sense. This was just so insta love and not the enemies to romance I was hoping for. Beyond disappointed.

And how I felt the next morning, telling him it wasn't to be.

            "⚠ Translation error: Dreams do Come True: Kids can be Adults Sometimes, Stevie Thomas read the letter once, and then twice, then a third time to be sure it was real. Then he started screaming. “Mom! Mom! Mom!” (3) As if something was wrong... This realistic fiction story, written by John Feinstein, takes place in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania during modern times. One of the main characters is Stevie Thomas. I rated this book a three out of five stars because it was a good book but it wasn’t the best one that I read so far. That I have read. The first couple sentences really made me want to know what Stevie’s letter was all about and what would happen as a result of the letter. The book it was impossible to put it down because it was holding back surprising details, it had readable vocabulary, and it trick the reader along the way. One of the reasons the book is impossible to put down is because it was holding back surprising details for example, the title misleads the reader into thinking the story will be about someone taking the last shot in an important game. However, the story is really about three young students reporting on high school and college basketball games. Another surprising detail in the book is when Stevie read the letter about winning the writing contest. He seemed really surprised and yelled like something was wrong or someone was out to get him. “Mom! Mom! Mom!” (3). Stevie realized he had won something big, but he wasn’t sure how his dream came true would work out. Thus, the surprising details made it hard to stop reading this book. Another reason the book is impossible to put down is because readable vocabulary. The content is easy to read, easy to follow, and I recognize some of the names of the teams. While reading this book, I realized we have some of the same interests in basketball like the Final Four. Stevie’s dad was able to create a lot of excitement about basketball in Philadelphia. “He had started taking Stevie to se Philadelphia’s big five Temple, Villanova, St. Joseph’s, Pennsylvania and La Salle when he was four” (3). I can follow the story pretty well because when I went to a Bulls game for the first time my interest got deeper in basketball like Stevie’s. I watch more games on TV and I would love to go to more games. Since I can relate to this book I just cannot put this book down. Furthermore, this book is impossible to put down because the author of the story tricks the reader into thinking that a major college basketball player is taking the final shot of an important game in the Final Four. It’s easy for the reader to believe this because it happens all the time in sports. For instance, when the Lakers were going against the Celtics last year in the seventh game and Kobe took over the game in the last quarter and won the game. “Steve Jorgensen had them both free in under a minute” (228) when he tried to get the tape to the Garry so like he’ trying to suck up to him. To conclude, the book, Last Shot by John Feinstein, it was impossible to put it down, because it was holding back surprising details, it had readable vocabulary and it tricks the reader along the way. I was able to make personal connections because I sort of can relate to this book. I can remember my first time at a basketball game just like Stevie can. We both had unexpected events, like when he won that contest and like when I won the conference for my football team. It sort of started like how Stevie’s victory started. My dad took me to a football game and I loved it. I just want to get on the field and play with them. I had to be about seven. I was still a little to young, but just like Stevie learning about basketball. I learned about football and we both had a dream like mine was to come in first place for our division and like he wanted to win the contest. We both accomplished our dreams this how I can relate to this book. I think I should get at least a (B) because I worked hard one this and I think its good for my first one. The most difficult thing about this was getting it done on time and it going to be hard getting use to doing a book review. I plan to improve by getting this in on time. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: Last Shot is a fiction book about Stevie and Susan Carol’s trip to the Final Four in New Orleans. They won this trip from a writing contest and they went there to write about the tournament. The book is a good book, in my opinion, and it makes the reader want to keep reading it. Throughout the book, Stevie and Susan Carol are trying to solve a mystery that involves the star player for Minnesota State University, Chip Graber. The mystery is very interesting to see how it unfolds throughout the book and the mystery keeps the book interesting. Last Shot is a good book and shows their trip from start to finish and how they go there looking to just have a fun trip to the Final Four while publishing news stories to now having to solve the biggest mystery of the tournament. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a sports book that is entertaining to read. The book is all about college basketball while adding a mystery to it. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: What if you overheard a conversation about blackmail and no one believed you. That’s what happened in my book, Last Shot by John Feinstein. In Last Shot, the main topics are basketball, collusion, cheating, greed and teamwork. The two main characters, Steve and Susan, are two 14 year old reporters who won a contest to send them to the Final Four in New Orleans. While they are trying to find a story, they overhear a conversation where someone is trying to blackmail the best player on the Michigan State University team, Chip Garber. The kids are overwhelmed and don’t know what to do. The whole book is about them trying to track down the blackmailers with some help from some important people. The themes evident in this book are persistence, teamwork, and selflessness. These themes are just some of the reasons to read this book. Some of the other reasons are the characters and the action-packed storyline. I think that the Author, John Feinstein, does a great job making the story of Steve, an undersized 14 year old boy who just wants to be looked at like a normal kid, relatable. For example, when Steve and Susan are trying to get into the Michigan State University locker room, Susan has no problem but the security guard stops Steve right in his tracks. Even though steve has his all access pass, that wasn’t enough for the guard. Susan had to walk back to the guard and tell them the story about both of them being sent to the final four, for winning a writing contest. Only after Susan told her anecdote would the guard let steve pass. Steve feels very inadequate after this exchange. He doesn’t like the fact that Suan had to “come rescue him” even though they were both the same age. I think most everyone can relate to wanting to fit in but there’s that one nagging trait that sets you apart. For Steve, it’s his height but for other people it could be their weight, their hair or even their family. Last Shot, also has one of the best storylines in a book that I’ve ever read. The action, adventure, suspense and humor all come at perfect times and after you read the book, it will make you feel bittersweet because the ending had a great conflict resolution but, there is no more book to read! Even though there is a lot going on in the book with the basketball, conspiracy, plot twists, and more, the plot is pretty easy to follow. In other words, you will never feel overwhelmed while reading this book like you might in others. One of my favorite plot twists is the story of Steve Jurgensen. The reader first comes across his name in the later chapters and he is an essential character for the rest of the book, even though we don’t actually meet him until the very last chapters. He starts out being the center of the blackmail circle but eventually comes to Steve and Susan’s side! In conclusion, this book was a very fun read. While this book may not offer intellectual gain, it does offer a very interesting story line and an important lesson. The story line is packed with plot twists, action and adventure and it gets better every page. The main lesson in Last Shot is to believe in yourself. If you were to tell Steve and Susan that they were going to stop a major blackmail conspiracy when they first landed in New Orleans, they would have told you that you had the wrong kids. They were only 14 and had only ever seen blackmail on crime shows. But at the end of the book, that’s exactly what happened. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: Scandals have fascinated the public since the founding of time. In America, journalists have seen them as a miracle, a hit story for the ages. This is no exception for Steven Thomas, who stumbles on the story of the century. Stevie Thomas must overcome many obstacles throughout the story to solve the mystery at the final four and write the story that will make or break his future career. In The Last Shot by John Feinstein, a young boy name Stevie Thomas living in Pennsylvania applies for a young basketball writers competition. After writing his story about the Palestra, UPenn’s Basketball arena, he wins the competition and wins a trip to the final four. Here he meets Susan Carol Anderson, the other contest winner. They hit it off and immediately become friends, and proceed to work on their articles for the Final Four. When they stumble upon Minnesota State’s star player, Chip Graber, and a suspicious man talking. They listen in on the conversation and realize they've come across the scandal of the century. Will Stevie be able to solve this mystery without getting in serious trouble, or worse? I strongly recommend this book for all sports fans and mystery lovers alike. This book has great character's, an exciting plot, and surprising conflict. A great read for all ages. John Feinstein, the author, does a great job of creating exciting plot points with many twists and turns along the way. For example, when Stevie and Susan Carol go to the hotel where the players are staying, they must get past elevator security. After they get a pass, they then run into another security detail, and yet again face more conflict.This shows how the author places good amounts of conflict with many ups and downs throughout the story. He also puts a good pace on the story because it never seems that the plot is being forced or over-developed. This can be credited to how the author spreads plot lines well without too much conflict or too many down parts of the book. This can be seen when Stevie and Susan Carol go to see the retired Dean of Students of MSU with Chip Graber. The author puts a page describing the drive there to put a pause in the story, spacing plot points. What John Feinstein could have done better is that often in the story dialogue can be forced at points in the book. For example, Chip Graber tells his story through college-type slang dialogue and it makes it hard to focus on the main points of the backstory. Overall, the author did very well writing the book and making an exciting story. I strongly recommend this book for all sports fans and mystery lovers alike. This book had many famous icons in the sport of basketball, and the mystery aspect adds a whole new layer to the exciting sports story. There is also great character development between unlikely associates and the use of teenage protagonists makes for a great story. Any lover of sports writing and mystery will love this book all the way through. This sports-fiction mystery novel is a great read with good character development and drama. The conflict is spaced well and the use of famous figures makes the story very relatable. Stevie’s adventure at the final four as a young journalist, uncovering the scandal of the century, brings forth an exciting plot with great characters in a true coming of age story. A great read for all people, regardless of age. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

What the heck was going on with the characters? It felt like every few sentences there was a new useless character introduced. In the beginning of the book the character Big Tex is introduced. That was compleatly unneeded. They also seemed to talk on and on about these players that I did not even need to know existed. And they talked about to many announcers and reporters? Compleatly unnecessary. The main character though. Stevie/Steven/Steve/Or whatever you want to call him's personality is awful. He is lame, and helpless. He also is very stupid and inconsiderate. He does not have any compassion and he is SUPER bias. Susan Carol. Susan Carol is to long of a name. Why not just Susan or Carol, or maybe SC. I just don't get it. She also is very forceful and sends Stevie mixed signals. I hate it. And Chip. He acts like he is 2 years old. Even stupid Steve is smarter than him. Why. Just why was this book written? I think the author of this book was drunk when writing this book. It is also very repetitive and has poor word choice. The only reason I read it was because it was a book club book I HAD to read for school. It was so incredibly boring I fell asleep twice when reading it. They litterly solved the mystery in the first two pages. I was also so confused when the whole story came out. And there was so much basketball mumbo jumbo that I did not need in there.

Damon is a a silver fox, yaws god please. Anyways, this was just alright for me sis. Like, what happened? I just wasnt vibing with Thad in the beginning, he made me wanna suffocate him. Then when it came to the actual romance and for the two of them, Thad and Kelley to fall in love it just wasnt that special. I feel like there was a lot to work with, but like the spark wasnt there for me. I needed more. Just more of everything. More of them building something, and or more pining for one other or some shit. I needed it because at the end of the day, Eden Finley books usually make me giggle and the jokes werent jokin this time so I was left to my on devises. Like I am probably in the minority with this book but I was kinda bored and im the queen of loving me some nothing happening in the book type books, like I love a boring book but girl you gotta give me something while giving nothing. Like yeah I love being in this world and to be fair and not like critiquing the book to my personal taste, its pretty good, like people will like it for sure, but I was wanting something more. I know Eden got it in her. Also why was Brady like the 3rd main character. Sir you had your own book bro, i havent read it, like back up. I kinda was more interested in Thad's roommates, I wanna know what the heck is going on with old boi who was dressing up as batman for kids parties, where is his book? Anyways it was just not for me, but hey its not a bad book for sure, just not my favorite characters ever, like I think this could of went in a very emotional direction with Kelley and his anxiety but it didnt even do that for me. RIP I am mensurating so it wouldnt of taken much to make me cry. Anyways thats enough information. or too much information.

Those of us who read Can't Say Goodbye already had an idea of where the plot would go. Even so, it's a book that can be read and enjoyed without having read any of the Sadenverse. The story follows Thad and Kelley, who have a rocky start to their relationship. However, living together forces them to realize they're not as different as they thought. The plot spans several months, allowing us to see how their bond develops. Both characters are just the sweetest. It's so lovely to see how they help each other to grow, and they make a truly beautiful couple to read about. I have to say, I don't know anything about softball, so I found the scenes where it's the main focus a bit long. They did distract me a bit from the reading, and I'm afraid that lowered my rating a little. I really enjoyed seeing Damon and Brady take part in the story. A great start to the series that has me looking forward to the next book already (and I'm going to reread Fakeboyfriends!). (ESP) Por fin llegó la serie que tanto hemos esperado!!! Y aquellos que leímos Can’t say goodbye ya teníamos una idea de por dónde iría la trama. Aún así, es un libro que puede perfectamente leerse y disfrutarse sin haber leído nada del Sadenverse. En esta historia tenemos a Thad y a Kelley quienes tienen un inicio de relación bastante difícil pero siendo obligados a convivir empezarán a descubrir que no son tan distintos como suponían. La trama sucede a lo largo de varios meses lo que nos permite ver cómo se va desarrollando el vínculo que los une y eso siempre suma. Ambos personajes son muy dulces y es notorio como se ayudan el uno al otro a crecer formando una pareja muy bella de leer. De igual modo, no sabiendo nada de softball me resultaron un tanto extensas las escenas en donde este deporte es la estrella, eso me distrajo un poco de la lectura y bajar un poco la puntuación. Hay mucha participación de Damon y Brady y eso me encantó!

Kathrine Switzer is famous for her 1967 running of the Boston Marathon with the bib \"261\" using her initials \"K.V.\" to register for what had up to then been an all-male race...forever changing running, women in running, women in sports, and so on. I guess I hadn't realized how women were basically not welcome in sports until the mid-1970s. The women's Olympic Marathon wasn't even in existence until 1984! And this was largely the effort of Switzer, who remains active in women's running (broadcasting, often for the Boston Marathon!). The common thinking was that running anything over 2 miles would cause women to become obese and not be able to have children and so on...crazy to even think about! I hadn't realized all that Switzer had done for women in running and women in general. I was amazed by her determination (and actually liked her writing too!) throughout the book - I feel inspired! Was especially interesting to see how times progressed (Switzer's 1967 Boston was over 4:10, she eventually ran a 2:53 I believe...she won the 1974 NYC Marathon [when it still did Central Park loops]). Cool to see how small the running community is/how tightly knit is...she discussed Higdon, Fred Lebow (started NYC Marathon...Fred's Team!), Bill Rodgers, Pre, so many more).

It was, however, a well documented and written account of not only what was common knowledge but also the behind-the-scenes activities of Lance Armstrong and the other bikers. The list of people that were aware that he and the other cyclists were using banned substances is amazing. Somehow his teams, the other cyclists, sponsors, and even those in charge of regulating were able to keep this secret from the general public. This book clearly shows just how well Lance was able to manipulate to get his way. It also shows how close the cycling community is and how far they go to protect their own. It is sad that so many of us were led to believe in the fairy tale that Lance spun. That he was the cancer survivor that made a great comeback and legally won the Tour de France over and over again. It is even more tragic that the foundation he set up to benefit cancer survivors was largely based on a lie. When these facts became more evident (even before his confession on Oprah), his life fell apart. Unfortunately, so did the strength of the Livestrong Foundation. This is a very interesting book that very clearly shows how the cycling community works. It touches on the training and preparation for tours as well as the personal connections. Mostly, it shows how one powerful man is able to control the behavior of others. It's a great good about a sad story. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

Instead, I gulped it down in an almost non-stop session, breaking only for bathroom breaks and sustenance. I am one of the fools drawn in by Mr. Armstrong and crew (as well as then entire bicycling sport) since I discovered it in 1997. One of the other reviewers basically said it all so I will quote him here (Loren Thacker Goodreads reviewer) \"This is a superb accounting of Lance Armstrong and his relationship with performance-enhancing drugs over the course of his ENTIRE professional bike racing career by two journalists from the Wall Street Journal. It is well-researched and well-written. For me, it closes the book on Lance Armstrong. I don't need to know anything more about him. He is now a non-entity to me, after years of foolishly believing him and of admiring his accomplishments.\" And then I will add a famous line from Kevin O'Leary from Shark Tank - \"he's dead to me.\" --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: So so so so many f'ing problems with this one that I honestly don't even know where to start. I made it to eight wtf's in this book before throwing my hands up and calling it quits. Sometimes, it's just not worth my sanity to stick it out. 1. Legs is shoved to her knees, her hair is yanked out, and has a cock almost shoved down her throat by a drunken football player. Drunk or not, that's not excusable behavior. Yet, she laughs it off after being saved by Killian, the QB. She has zero problem with what happened & zero problems being around the perv later in the book! Wtf!?!? 2. Legs is constantly referring to her weeping, leaking, clinching vagina and the fear that it will stain up whatever she is sitting on - stools, upholstery, etc. Nasty visual, man... Like a dog in heat, seriously! 3. Cliches, cliches everywhere. • She's plain Jane. • He is professional football sex Gawd. • She has the black, gay BFF. • He has anger management issues. • Shes a blushing, weeping, vaginal doormat. •Insta-love, insta-relationship. • He's into kink rules and nudity. • She's insecure about mosquito bite breasts, & she's so inexperienced she might as well be a virgin, on birth control already for her periods, of course, & that has a kinky BFF that allows her to be in the know, of course, about his brand of kink rules. On and on I could go~ 4. The author tries TOO HARD in her POVs. Overkill to be stereotypically non-stereotypical! Irony?!? Yes! Quirky and innocent? Uhm, no! Legs comes off as a spastic, spineless, thirsty, hormonal dick-fan girl. She's the chick that you avoid being friends with like the chickenpox. Alpha? Uhm, no! Killian comes off as a selfish, commanding, douche hat that belongs back in the era pre- women's rights movement. NOTE TO ALL ROMANCE WRITERS: Alpha men are demanding out of need to provide, protect, & pleasure what's \"mine.\" They don't want to show off what's theirs, they need to know it's theirs and theirs alone. So, Killian is just a demanding dick with a God complex. 5. He drives her home from a party. He drives her home from a football game. They spend the night screwing. That's the extent of their interactions before the next am they go bareback. He's a professional athlete for f's sake and she has no qualms about this bareback shit? Brings doormat vagina a whole new kind of visitor ;/ ehhh! 6. \"Fuck pad\" and \"fuck toys.\" \"Tapping the sweet pussy.\" Have mercy on me~! 7. The way he treats her and the way she concedes makes me feel dirty. For example, she doesn't have on a bra and she already has two buttons undone on her shirt. He unbuttons two more before heading out on their first date. \"Killian, please, I don't feel comfortable.\" Mortification caused tears in my eyes. \"You are the sexiest woman I've ever seen. I don't understand why you hide that gorgeous body.\" He kisses her to shut her up and she says: \"what else could I do.\" He unbuttons another button at the restaurant. Five buttons? So she's basically sitting there naked?!? Sexy if that's what she wants and how she wants to dress. Not so sexy when she's about to cry over it and allows herself to be forced pressured into it. 8. Her a week into the relationship... Oops, she's said that to other guys... They... He, the rich professional football player.... Unbelievable, right? Plus, there is nothing at all romantic about her admitting that she's has done the exact same thing with ALL her other relationships . So what makes this shit special? Nothing! What's endearing about a chick that latches on and immediately wants HEA with any guy that pays her attention? I dont know, but I do know... --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: Okay, I loved the pretty pictures and the ''extra info'' - freezability, whether there is gluten or soy in a recipe, how to substitute beans you've cooked yourself for the canned option, etc. HOWEVER, if a stated premise is to making things as clear and efficient as possible, I think it is cheating to say ''prep time 20 minutes'' for a recipe when the ingredients list calls for ''6 cups of vegetables, chopped'' and also a recipe for sauce that is elsewhere in the book and that takes 20 minutes to make. No, you will not get this on the table in 20 minutes. I usually dedicate an hour and a half to cooking supper for our household of 3 adults and 2 kids, and if I finish a bit early, it means I can wash the prep dishes or do some baking or make some broth for the next day or make a Bulk Barn list. Also, Liddon's writing voice is a little bit annoying to me. I am not vegan, but I like to cook vegetarian more often than not, and it was good to find some new ways to use cabbage (we get cabbage every fall in our CSA, and it's always like, help, what shall we do with this cabbage this time) and quinoa (you can only make quinoa bowl so many times) and squash, which we buy en masse at the end of the season and cook into the winter so that we can keep using local veg instead of those from Mexico. So yes, nothing groundbreaking in the way of flavour profile or technique here, and I'm not going to suddenly start pulling out the blender/food processer for every meal, but I did find some recipes to try in order to shake it up a bit in my winter cooking life. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: Bloody brilliant! Oh my lawd this book is everything I hoped it was going to be and then some. I do love me an office rivalry romance and, when you get down into the nitty gritty of this one, it's easy to see how Archer Holloway and Lincoln Fox have ended up in this position. Of course, there's far more to what's on the surface and as both men are made to work together to support the Dalton brothers (and yes we get loads of Asher antics that had me howling), things take a turn. A turn for the my real thoughts come out when I'm drunk front in Fox's case as it becomes very clear that there's some seriously repressed feelings there not only about Archer, but also about how Fox has become someone he doesn't recognise himself. There's some wonderfully honest communication in this book, that doesn't always occur when Fox has indulged in a tad too much spiced rum, but because Archer genuinely does like Fox, always has, and he's never quite understood why he's been enemy number one since his office arrival. He pushes Fox to the limit and, eventually, he snaps and the UST that's been there since the start, gets a full workover. But, it's always been about more than just finding each other attractive and not knowing what to do about it. They push and pull at each other because they're scared of failure, they're envious of what they see in the other as strengths they don't have, and both men fail to realise that they've been pushing each other into being even more competitive, instead of collaborative. Our man Damon's on hand mind, to lay down some home truths, to push them together, and to make them have to find a way forward otherwise the Dalton contract is toast. The banter and the snark in this one is superb, never mind the chaos, it's a perfect blend of King Sports and Puckboy guest appearances, and the romance itself, one Fox gets out of his own way, is really beautiful. Archer gets Lincoln, he's just been waiting for the other guy to see him properly too, and once he does, well all bets are on! There's so much potential in this series, I cannot wait to see where Eden takes things next, but I absolutely adored watching Archer and Lincoln fall in love. #ARC kindly received from the author via Foreword PR, I am voluntarily leaving a review --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: I really can't call myself a sports fan. I began watching college football as a teenager, drawn in by the magnetic fan base of the Oklahoma Sooners. I lived less than 10 miles from Sooner Stadium. That led to watching NFL games as a fan of America's Team, the Dallas Cowboys. I was a dad with two preteen boys when I added major league baseball to my sporting interests, with frequent trips to Arlington Stadium to watch the Texas Rangers play. As for Al Michaels, I know him mostly as the voice of MNF. Yet, the moment I stumbled across this book, I decided to read it. I am glad I did. I found it fascinating. It is unfair to describe the book as an autobiography, because Michaels focuses on only one aspect of his life; his broadcasting career. It isn't a titillating memoir full of revelations about the people he has known. It is a retelling of an incredible career of one of the most recognized voices in the sporting world. Along the way, he draws in stories of the people he has worked with, and of players, owners, coaches and a host of other people brought across his path by his career. I have lived through a lot of that career, and the events that shaped it. The Cold War, the first ripples of terrorism, the San Francisco earthquake, and others. I found it fascinating to be reminded of how these moments of history affected the world of sports. Michaels' retelling of the 1980 Olympic Hockey game in which a group of \"college kids\" beat the undisputed greatest team in the world, in a timely meeting of international, political rivals, the USA and the USSR, propelled me to the Disney Channel to watch Miracle, engrossed for the 30 minutes or more of watching that famous match replayed, and listening to Al Michaels call the game. I have no interest in hockey as a sport, but Al Michaels had me pumping my fist in the air when Team USA tied the game and when they scored the go-ahead point. When the clock ran out with a Team USA victory, my hands were in the air as Michael's asked, \"Do you believe in miracles?\" These factors play heavily into my 5* star rating. You Can't Make This Up isn't just about Al Michael's career. It's also about the world I have lived in, history I lived through, and people I have cheered for and admired in the sporting world. Take that away, and this would be a 4* read at best, a solid 3.5 for sure. Based on a lot of the reviews of this work, I think it fair to say that the less the reader is connected to these factors of history and personalities, the less the book will appeal to them. But don't take that as a given. You might be surprised at how much you like the book if you read it for what it is, a good story of an exceptional career as a broadcaster in the wide, wide world of sports. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: I recently saw a clip of Al Michaels on Jimmy Kimmel's show which found him regaling the audience with a story about Howard Cosell that was so meandering and pace-less, nobody seemed to know when it was over, even Kimmel. That's kind of how Michaels' book is throughout, but it's still an enjoyable read if you're a fan of sports and sports history. Reading his stories of rising through the broadcast ranks, from calling baseball games on student radio at the University of Arizona to announcing the Super Bowl the last several years running, is the book equivalent of listening to your uncle's tales at the family reunion -- you're having fun listening to them, but not nearly as much fun as he is telling them. Still, Michaels is probably the most famous sports broadcaster alive next to Bob Costas, and that means he's lead an interesting life. He's called World Series, boxing matches, Monday Night Football, and the Olympics. His call of the \"Miracle on Ice\" game at the 1980 Olympics remains one of the great moments in sports and sports announcing, and is probably the moment Michaels became a star. I revisited the broadcast on YouTube after reading the book, and the drama and power of those closing moments still makes my spine tingle. Michaels' and his cowriter L. Jon Wertheim's framing device, spelled out in the title, is unnecessary and enhances the old guy yammering to whoever'll listen quality of the book (really, Uncle Michaels? you worked with Howard Cosell while he was acting like an asshole? you're right -- you really \"CAN'T make this up!\") But it's interesting revisiting some great sports moments from the perspective of the broadcast booth, and for people like myself who are interested in the career of broadcasting in general, Michaels is surprisingly forthcoming about how he built a career for himself and what it took to rise through the ranks (hint: you have to be really, really committed.) --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: Giada at Home / 978-0-30745-101-9 Part cookbook, but with biographical elements that provide interesting insight and reading into the featured chef's adjustment from Italian cuisine to American cuisine, and her fusion attempts with both, this book is an interesting read with several mouth-watering recipes. Many of the recipes feature full-page finished photos, and most of the Italian cuisine dialect is carefully explained to the reader (finally, I now know the difference between prosciutto and pancetta). It's worth remembering, when considering the purchase of this book, that the recipes here may be challenging for some American palates. Although Giada has tastefully combined American cuisine with her Italian childhood memories, the Italian flavors shine through heavily. Many of the recipes call for ingredients that may not be found outside of the nearest specialty market, almost none of the recipes utilize beef (and even the chicken and pork recipes are fairly sparing on the meat content), and there is a noticeable reliance on salty flavors in the meat and cheese dishes. Of course, none of this makes the cookbook less worthy of purchase, but like all specialty cookbooks, I would recommend flipping through a few recipes before purchase. Having said that, this is a very nice specialty cookbook - the flavor and variety are appreciated, the writing style is quite engaging, the pictures are beautiful, and the assembly instructions are adequate (although I would prefer pictorial assembly instructions where applicable, but I suppose that's a bit much to ask from a specialty book).

            "⚠ Translation error: Murder of the century? Really? Which one? Not well organized. It was so confusing that I was forever going back to see who/what the author was talking about. Easy to put down. I read a little bit for short periods of time - not compelling enough to keep my attention. One would think that the \"Murder of the Century\" would keep you intrigued. It did do one thing well: I got a good night's rest every time I picked it up at bedtime. Not sure how the title applies - It didn't convince me that the crime was \"the murder of the century.\" Perhaps that description is so overused now that it has lost meaning. Certainly it did not have the impact of the Simpson trial or the Scopes Monkey Trial because I never heard of it before. The story that interested me most was the war among the newspapers / publishers. Proving that FOX News did not invent sensationalism, news reporters of the day were shameless in their pursuit of a salable story. Because the author tried to cram too much information about both the media and the crime, the book became a disjointed account of forensics & media reaction. This was a time during which police didn't secure crime scenes & news people had unlimited access-that in itself should have made for a compelling read. Perhaps The author could have used a little more sensationalism in his writing? Lots of interesting information that should have created a compelling story. The author could have focused on one subject and written two books: media sensationalism or crime/forensics. If he wanted both subjects, he could have styled it more like Erik Larson's The Devil in the White City - which had had better continuity. All is not lost if you trudge through this book. If you get through the labyrinth of information your reward will be information with which you can make impressive cocktail conversation. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: I won an advance reader copy of this book from a Goodreads giveaway and Crown Publishing, and I want to thank them for the opportunity to read and review this book. Murder of the Century: The Gilded Age Crime that Scandalized a City & Sparked the Tabloid Wars covers the recovery of a torso, arms, and various parts of a man found in the river in New York City in 1897 and the ensuing trail both inside and out of the courtroom. The bizarre murder sparks controversy from the very beginning when multiple people arrive to identify the remains, and cannot agree upon who was murdered. The case becomes more and more strange as the trial approaches and the media empires of Hearst and Pulitzer square off the get the scoop first. The main interest of this book comes in with the fierce battle over information and competition between the two rival tabloid newspapers, stunts that would even shock 21st century news media consumers (at one point the crime scene is bought so reporters from that particular newspaper would have exclusive access to it). Moreover, this case was just before the advent of modern forensic science. The medical examiners dismiss fingerprints as reliable evidence and the forensic toxicologist, though a brilliant expert, does not quite yet have an expert reputation in the courtroom. With the stranger details of the case arriving, a modern reader yearns for some sort of physical evidence for that \"aha!\" moment in a whodunnit; this was before much of the \"CSI\" forensic science was invented or recognized as effective or credible. Overall, it is surprising how little overage of sensational crimes has changed in the United States since the late 1800's. At one point, the book quotes the New York Herald 's publisher saying \"The newspaper are becoming the only efficient police, the only efficient judges that we have.\" Trials begin conducted in the newspaper, even without forensic evidence, is something that appears to be a fixture in American news coverage. While the topic was interesting and well researched, I had some issues with the tone in which this book was written. It is non-fiction and well researched, having the endnotes to prove it. However, the author uses quotes from these sources in a way that seems like the historical figures are speaking it immediately as dialogue in a scene from a novel. This is a bit confusing, especially when at first I couldn't tell if this was true crime, history, or something in between. The press coverage, as explained in \"A Note on the Text\", allowed the author to use many eyewitness sources. It took a while getting used to and the details of the crime, tabloids, and forensic science at the time are worth it. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: Whenever I read books like this, I always think about how people (usually older people) like to reminisce about the \"good old days\" when everyone was somehow magically moral, upstanding, and law-abiding. Then I chuckle a bit. Okay, so maybe it's a little weird to be chuckling when I'm reading a book about a murder, but cut me some slack. It amuses me that anyone would think that immorality is confined to the modern age. Yes, even back in those alleged \"good old days,\" people were murdering each other for stupid reasons and trying to cover it up in bumbling, ineffectual ways. The story begins on a hot summer day in the late 1890s, when some boys playing in a river in NYC fish out a wrapped package that they think will hold something of value. Instead, it holds part of a dead man's body. What follows is a sensational tale of infidelity, divorce, back room abortions, yellow journalism, and, of course, murder most foul. Honestly, except for the dismembered body (which always seems to rev up people's outrage factor), the murder turns out to have been rather pedestrian. Still, the book is a fairly fun read and it was obviously well researched. I've read more engaging true crime, but I've also read much more poorly written true crime.

Collins, whose other books I now must seek out, has done insanely extensive research (there are forty pages of sources and notes) to retell a scandalous tale of Gilded Age New York that was followed in newspapers around the globe. Picture New York in 1897 where Harlem is a land of farms and a place to go berry-picking. Picture the newspaper magnet William Randolph Hearst as a young and ambitious contender willing to do anything to stake his claim in the newspaper biz - above Joseph Pulitzer. McKinley's not yet gone to war in the Phillipines. Teddy Roosevelt is still freshly remembered as the NYC Police Commissioner. Picture a barber shop, a soda shop, the local bakery, the piers, the Bowery, tenement houses and the Fourth of July - all this (and more) plays into this intriguing tale of a murder fueled by infidelity, jealousy and deception, and an investigation that takes you from Manhattan to Harlem to Long Island and back again. And tabloids, called \"yellow newspapers,\" had the story that would put them on the map and in the money. The crime is grisly, the characters shady yet strangely sympathetic, the evidence and methodology questionable, the public interest at a fever-pitch and the drama rather unstoppable. The narrative is packed with quotations taken from first hand reports and trial transcripts diligently researched and documented. These details add so much color that you can practically feel the street mud on your boots, the nickle for the paper in your pocket and hear the newsboys crying out another headline. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

This crime, while an event for its day, was unknown to me (and I read a goodly amount of true crime). It is a love triangle between a woman and her two lovers. The crime takes place in 1897 at the beginning of the advent of forensics - fingerprinting is just being proposed, there is little in the way of crime scene preservation as the police, press, and rubberneckers flock to potential crime sites, and the identification of victims is a tedious process in a morgue without refrigeration. The victim - eventually identified as William Guldensuppe - is found in pieces (torso, arms, legs) and his head was never found despite extensive searches by the police, the press and the general public. The pair accused of his murder are his lover Augusta Nack and her current beau Martin Thorn. The murder and subsequent trials fire up the press (and there were scads of papers then) and the general public. The 'press wars' eventually come down to Hearst's Journal and Pultizer's World . The pressure of attempting to scoop each other actually contributes to the solving of the crime as both papers were investigating side-by-side and, sometimes even ahead (no pun intended), of the police.

Children found a torso, sans head, floating along in the East River. Police shrugged it off as a prank by medical students, until the next day when more pieces were discovered in the Harlem River. The way that the identity of the victim was uncovered was really wild, but I will not spoil it for those who are unfamiliar with this case and are interested in the book. I can assure you I would have never thought about checking any location such as that for a missing person, but someone certainly thought of it and helped to blow the case wide open. This book definitely took some turns I was not expecting. The Gilded Age was a really dramatic time. I would also like to note that it seems crazy to me to do reenactments of the murder in the middle of Times Square, but I suppose the reenactments that we watch on True Crime shows is essentially the same thing. I find it equally crazy that MEDICAL STUDENTS would leave body parts from their cadavers laying around for shits and giggles. I have the Audible version of this book, which I really enjoyed. If you are interested in the physical copy, it is a little less than 300 pages. I thought it was really well done. The research was sufficient. I really learned a lot about this case. I always like learning about older cases like this. I think it is really interesting to see how tabloid news has continued to feed off of scandal and tragedy all the way up to the present day. I know I have always picked up the tabloid magazines while waiting in the grocery store checkout, but TMZ has really left a bad taste in my mouth for things like this. I find them to be the bottom of the barrel and just scummy.

Both stories, the one of the crime and the story of the rise of tabloid journalism are informative and at times shocking. It reminds readers of the murder of Nicole Brown and the trial of her ex-husband O.J. Simpson in 1995 when the same craziness was repeated. In both public trials, a crazy circus evolved. Large numbers of potential jurors ran the gauntlet before the lawyers until the required number was selected. High profile defense attorneys stalked the courtroom insisting on their client’s innocence and vowing to win the case. Residents living in the areas near the courtroom rented out rooms to roving reporters. Hastily assembled food wagons delivered coffee and snacks. It seemed everyone was out to make money. Newspaper accounts of both trials shoved aside the national and international news. The Guldensuppe trial was the one that helped create the twenty-four hour news industry and the O.J. trial fanned its flames. It remains healthy and flourishes to this day. And in both criminal cases when it was all over, many benefited from the notoriety engendered by the entire process. Promotions were awarded, new careers were launched, life stories and memoirs were written and books detailing the investigation and trial appeared soon after the cases were closed. This book has been solidly researched with plenty of source notes. By skillfully combining the tabloid frenzy with the ghastly and sensational murder, Collins has produced a very readable and interesting narrative. It includes a fascinating cast of characters, probably better than one could ever imagine for a book of fiction.

            "⚠ Translation error: Kondou Seiichirou is an overworked accountant who's heading home one evening when he hears a girl crying out for help. He rushes to her, only to get pulled along with her into a new world where she's expected and wanted and he's...an unexpected extra. The girl, Shiraishi Yua, is named the next Holy Maiden, a girl destined to save the kingdom from a deadly miasma. Kondou is asked what he'd like to do, and he requests an accounting job. It doesn't take long for Kondou to start digging in places he isn't wanted, attracting some powerful enemies. He notices something fishy going on in the kingdom's accounting books and makes it his personal mission to clean things up and ensure that the country is financially stable enough to weather the hardships he's sure the miasma will soon cause. In the process, he overworks himself to the same degree he was overworked back in his own world, and tries to make up for it with \"nutritional tonics.\" Thankfully, at least one of the people keeping a close eye on him is willing to help him out when he suddenly ends up in trouble. This reminded me intensely of The Saint's Magic Power Is Omnipotent . Isekai fantasy romance in which two people are accidentally transported into a new world instead of just one. One of those people is a Holy Maiden who's supposed to help dispel a miasma. Instead of being labeled another potential true \"Holy Maiden,\" Kondou, unlike Sei, was just dismissed entirely as being unimportant. However, Kondou, like Sei, requested to be put to work and immediately began overworking himself just as much as he'd done in the real world. Some differences: Of course, the m/m romance aspect. Plus, Kondou's love interest, Aresh, isn't so much sparklingly perfect as he is intensely serious. Aresh spends pretty much this entire volume glaring at Kondou from the sidelines. Also, there's no sign that Kondou has any magical abilities - he drinks healing potions rather than makes them. So far, Yua, the Holy Maiden, hasn't gotten much page-time, but it's being strongly hinted at that she's being used and the situation (deadly miasma that only she can clear) may not be exactly what she's been told. Like Aira, she's young, naive, and seems to accept everything she's being told. As far as the romance goes, that's still in the early stages and not exactly what I'd call romance yet. Basically, Kondou overuses nutritional tonics in an attempt to work past his normal limits and ends up overdosing. Aresh heals him with magic which then causes new problems, as Kondou's non-magical self proves incapable of properly processing all that magic. Infants in this world sometimes have this problem, which their mothers cure by cuddling and holding them in order to gradually build up their tolerance to magic. Kondou's an adult though, and this particular case is more serious than what infants experience, so Aresh has to rely on emergency treatment. Namely, sex. The sex isn't explicit, but it definitely happens...and Kondou's biggest reaction, upon waking up, is horror that he's late for work. Does he remember the sex? I'm not sure. Anyway, I'm interested to see where this goes and will be reading the next volume. Extras: A bonus chapter from the POV of the boy from whom Kondou commissioned an abacus. Also, one full-color illustration and a couple afterwords, one from the artist and one from the original light novel author.

(The quote is usually misconstrued to refer to Oakland as a whole.) The foreword by Congresswoman Lee is AWESOME and should be given out to anyone and everyone who criticizes The Town!!! And then there is the Author’s Note: “This book went to press in late 2022 before the future of the A’s - Oakland or Las Vegas - was resolved.” All the pride that pumped me up from the forward immediately drained from my soul… 4 World Series. 4 NBA titles. 2 Super Bowls. In the mid-1970s all 3 teams won league championships! The A’s won 3 World Series’ in a row in 1972, 1973, and 1974! The Warriors won their title in 1975, and the Raiders won the Super Bowl in 1976! “One American city - five national titles in three sports in a two-year span, in Oakland, California.” (during that era, this reader was ages 2 to 6! Lucky little me!) “… and the wordy Oakland Alameda County Coliseum Complex then received the justified distinction of ’House of Champions.” Chapter Two, “House of Champions: Hometown Memories” is a really good read! It lays out the rich, deep sports legacy of Oakland, detailing the different teams’ successes! It also lists the homegrown sports greats that came from The Town, a list that includes some of the greatest athletes to ever play in their respective sports! Oakland ruled!!! I also loved this, from chapter 7: “Dave Stewart is Oakland, and Oakland is Dave Stewart.” Fun fact for me - he beat Roger Clemens 9 out of 10 times! He, and his Death Stare, should be in Cooperstown! “Three things can’t stay hidden for long: the sun, the moon, and the truth. Fisher is doing a fantastic job of hiding his end game…”. “John Fisher is the ownership re-creation of Charles O. Finley.” Now contrarily, Franklin Mieuli (chapter 6) seems like my kind of owner! Totally the opposite of Fisher, in every way! I wish someone like him would wrest the A’s away from awful John… “money-grubbing sports owners who don’t give a hoot about Oakland.” “A perfect epitaph on Oakland’s sports tombstone: FANS GAVE UNSELFISHLY, OWNERS ACCEPTED GREEDILY, AND FRANCHISES MOVED HEARTLESSLY.” --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: The Ghosts of Belfast review, Part III Part I http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... Part II http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... Part IV http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... The Troubles, continued Casualties, continued Violence level: comparisons to U.S. After doing a lot of calculations and comparisons, I decided to just summarize my conclusions here. If anyone wants to see the data the next spoiler section is where to look. Basically, my conclusion is that the Troubles were an unhappy time in Northern Ireland not so much because of the absolute levels of violence, but rather (at least for the people living there) because of violence levels relative to the time preceding the Troubles, and because of other aspects of the violence discussed in the next section. That this should be the case (assuming I’m correct) perhaps should not be surprising. Nevertheless, to me, it was surprising. Basically, the levels of violence (expressed numerically as homicide rates) in Northern Ireland during the years of the Troubles were either clearly below , or slightly above the rates in the U.S. as a whole. If we attempt to compare numbers for Belfast only, to American cities, then no matter what assumptions are used to produce the Belfast numbers, the rates are roughly comparable to what has been seen in many American cities for many years, and are actually far less than some rates in some cities. These facts are my reason for saying that the absolute levels of violence during the Troubles were not a sufficient cause for the “reputation” that Northern Ireland had during the Troubles. Numbers and more numbers I estimate that the population of Northern Ireland averaged about 1.58 million people during The Troubles, based on data downloaded from http://www.nisra.gov.uk/demography/de... . Based on U.S. 10 year census figures, I estimate the U.S. population during these 33 years to have averaged 239 million. Scaling up the 107 deaths per year by the factor (239/1.58) gives 16,185 per year, or 534 thousand for 33 years in a country with the population of the U.S. Over half a million deaths. This sounds horrendous. But then I wondered what a half million deaths over a 30+ year period would mean in the U.S. So I tried to put this half-million casualty comparison in context. The first thing I was able to establish was that over the same period the U.S. had about 1.5 million traffic deaths. Okay, those are accidents , not purposeful acts of violence. A more useful comparison would simply be homicide totals. For a U.S. figure, I found (at http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/u... ) a table showing the number of murders by year in the U.S., and found that over the years 1969-2001, there were 19,900 murders per year (on average) in the U.S. To get a figure for Northern Ireland, I started with the number 3529 (the Trouble related deaths were all homicides for this purpose), but then what about the background homicides that were presumably committed but were not included in the Troubles statistics of the time? I found that there were no easily obtainable figures. Some of the reasons for this are discussed in http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/resear... , on the CAIN site. This article also mentions that Northern Ireland has in fact a very low overall crime rate, but that “although the overall crime rates are low it has a high rate of serious crime, such as homicide and robbery. These crimes are almost exclusively associated with terrorism and the \"troubles\". This statement would seem to indicate that the number 3529 could just be used as the homicide total for Northern Ireland; although one wonders about the phrase “almost exclusively”. I decided to use two totals for Northern Ireland; the above total, and a second one that would be the sum of that number and a background homicide rate that I would estimate as best I could. Unfortunately, the best I was able to do was to use a vague and unattributed statement in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in... that Northern Ireland “nowadays” averages “3-4 murders a month”. That would be roughly 42 per year “nowadays”. But “nowadays” Northern Ireland has a population of about 1.8 million (2010), so the 42 per year is equivalent to 37 per year in the lower population era of the Troubles. So total one for Northern Ireland homicides (during the Troubles) will be 107 per year, and total two will be (very tentatively) 144 per year. Homicide rates for years 1969-2001, per 100,000 population U.S.\t\t\t19,900/2 --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

The went missing on Memorial Day 1992. Thomas Austin is a consultant but has a personal interest in this case. His mother is a Navy Jag Officer. First brought in by NCIS, then shut out.

He is reflective but does want to move on. He's just not sure how to do so. I've been thinking about this series and why I love it so much. I've talked about the well drawn characters but I think there are two things that set this apart from other mystery/thrillers. One - each book is divided into three distinct parts. And those parts make sense to the story. Two - normally mysteries end with solving the crime. The author takes us further so we learn more about what happens after the arrest. I appreciate this. I would highly recommend this book (and series) to mystery/thriller readers.

            "⚠ Translation error: A well researched account of the crime wave that swept across the Midwestern United States in the early years of the Great Depression. In my opinion interesting for it's look at the last gasp of the colorful, daring, individualistic, outlaw criminal class. By the early 1930's the world was changing. For better or worse the United States Federal government was becoming more centralized and beginning to control greater resources - quickly surpassing what state and local governments could call on. The population was becoming more regulated (income tax, social security,voter registration rolls, driver licenses), connected (telephones, automobiles, telegraphs, radio) and urban. The 19th century was fading away and the fast moving motor bandits ,like Dillinger, were actually artifacts from the previous century. They had a brief, but glorious comeback in the late Twenties and early Thirties for a number of reasons. Technology (automobiles & automatic weapons) gave them the ability to move rapidly and overwhelm the poorly equipped/trained/paid police officers of that time. The laws restricted the ability of the various state and local police agencies to pursue across different jurisdictional boundaries and ,with the onset of the Depression, they found many sympathizers within the population who would aid them. Oh and organized crime also allowed them access to it's considerable resources. More than a blow by blow account of the F.B.I.'s pursuit of the motor bandits Bryan Burrough provides a look at a transitional time in America's past. Now it's true that change is always happening, but there are moments in history when the changes are almost quantum leaps and the Great Depression was one of those moments. In the early thirties Americans were becoming used to being part of a bigger, centrally organized society. It had been happening since the Civil War, but it accelerated with World War One and then the New Deal under F.D.R. made it essential. It was vital that Americans felt like they could look to the Federal government for many different things. The maintenance of law and order was one of the biggies. The bandits were too popular with many in the population. They were making a laughing stock of the police and undermining the authority of the government. The New Deal required people to believe in the competence of the government and it's employees. The bandits had to be brought down.. Hoover wanted the job and it was handed to him and his F.B.I. Burrough provides a blow by blow account and at times it gets rather dry, but I like the fact that he also shows a pivotal time in the United States and writes about the changes.He did not set out to provide a pulp-fiction account. He didn't write and episode for Gangbusters. As a police officer I could see the beginning of modern law enforcement as I read the book. It's a shaky start and at times the F.B.I.'s actions are bungling and frustrating. It was a very steep learning curve and the agents were starting with no foundation under their feet. But through luck (some of it dumb), hard work, the growing realization that they had greater resources and figuring out how to employ those resources (to include passing Federal laws which resulted in the Mob cutting them off from assistance) ,and the bandits eventually making too many mistakes, the Bureau and different police agencies got most of the bandits. Burrough shows what law enforcement is about. Much of it is tedious, boring and requires a slavish attention to detail. Occasionally it is broken up by moments of violence and terror and humor. It's a well written account. It isn't sensationalized, it isn't a character assassination of J. Edgar Hoover and it isn't a fluff piece. It's solid, well-researched and intelligently written. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: Most Filipinos still look up to America as their savior. This was rooted on the fact that the US was the one that liberated the Philippines from the Japanese during World War II. The US granted the Philippines its post-war independence on July 4, 1946 in the Treaty of Manila. However, the military bases treaty was rejected by the Philippine Senate in September 1991 and so the dreams of many young men to have a chance to join the US navy just ceased. My brother was one of those who were fortunate to get the nod of the navy screening officers in July 2006, six months after the 1986 EDSA revolution. We grew up loving everything American. I still remember that during the 70’s and early 80’s, we used to eat California apples and oranges only during Christmas. My grandmother’s third husband served in the Fil-Am military during the war so she was allowed to go inside the military bases. Part of her visits to the bases was to purchase PX goods (means import-restricted grocery items) from the bases’ commissary stores. I used to look forward to those trips to the bases because those were the only times I could have some Pringles, marshmallow, corned beef and other imported goods that were not available outside the military bases. Part of that love for everything American was not only limited to their grocery items. We also imbibed their culture: music, fashion, books and even films. Even up to now, we flock to the bookstores during the release of famous American books or still stay tuned to National Book Awards or Pulitzer and buy and read their nominated and winning books. We still look at the list of New York Times Bestsellers that one of the bookstore chains in the country visibly posts in their outlets. We still watch Oscar-award nominated and winning movies. Oh I loved Hollywood. Watching the Oscars used to be the most-awaited annual event for me while growing up. This includes watching everything they create including gangster films. In 1967, for example, Warner Bros., Seven Arts’ Bonnie and Clyde was one the 5 nominated films for the Best Picture then a couple of years after, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid also got the jurors’ nod. Of course, the 70’s was dominated by the Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather 's first two parts and was capped by the final part sometime in the early 80’s. The three parts of the series made a record in the Oscars as the only trilogy that each part was nominated in the Oscar Best Picture award. Only the first two won. I loved those gangster films. I still vividly remember how Bonnie and Clyde looked like in that movie and the final scene before they died. I enjoyed and held my breath while watching Butch and his partner got cornered and died. I watched countless times the Godfather series then I bought their copies in all formats: Beta, VHS, VCD, DVD and last year, Blu-Ray. This book, Public Enemies chronicles the founding and the rise to power of the most-admired and most-feared (by the criminals) organization in the US – the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation). No history of FBI, of course, can be said without mentioning its first director, J. Edgar Hoover (1895-1972). He was appointed in 1924 to head the Bureau of Investigation and he founded FBI in 1935. He was still its chief when he died in 1972. He had some excesses and it is for this reason why FBI directors now are limited to 10-year terms. We all know about the Depression Era in the 30’s. We were shocked to read about this – in relation the the Dust Bowl - in John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath , Saul Bellow’s The Adventures of Augie March and Karen Hesse’s Out of the Dust. The characters in those works suffered a lot because of poverty: lack of job, lack of food. Some resourceful elements in the society, on the other hand, did not wait for them to die hungry. Pretty Boy Floyd (1904-1934), an American bank robber, was said to be have only been a victim of hard times. The Depression era gave birth not only to Floyd but to a flurry of criminal gangs carrying out large numbers of bank robberies especially in the Midwest. They outran and outsmarted the FBI organization, while in its infantile stage, by having superior firepower and fast getaway cars. For example, the book says that Bonnie was not good in handling guns, what made him escape the police each time was his excellent driving skills. Alvin “Creepy” Karvis (1907-1979) known for his alliance with Barker Gang and his being the last public enemy to be taken. However, the --> No translation was found using the current translator.

Unfortunately, Flick is terrified of hurting her and hurting himself, so he's planning to leave her any moment. The perfect moment comes up when Flick is tapped by a guy named Lucian Mandel to attend a special school for street kids. The school basically teaches people to be white-collar criminals – and it’s kinda crazy. Flick is not interested, but Mandel has some information that Flick really, desperately wants in order to fulfill what Flick feels is his duty in life. In order to get that information, Flick agrees to be a student at Mandel Academy. In doing so, he discovers the seedy underbelly of New York's corporate criminals, and whether he can stomach everything that Mandel Academy is in order to pursue his duty. Confession: I didn't expect to like this as much as I did. I couldn’t remember the synopsis when I first started reading, so when I started, I wasn’t sure if the protagonist was a boy or a girl. It didn’t even matter. I was immediately drawn in to the rich, dark atmosphere of Flick’s New York: a dark, dank place full of petty thieves and people looking out for themselves. Sadly, the above is pretty much all I can tell you about the plot and characters without spoiling anything. Seriously, you do NOT want me to say anything else. This book is chock-full of twists, and every time I thought I knew what was going to happen, Miller would throw another thing at me. She also revealed things way earlier than I expected her to, keeping me guessing at every turn. I honestly did not know how this one was going to end, or even where the next chapter was going to lead me.

            "⚠ Translation error: So this is a review that has been a long time coming- and AGAIN, I have to apologize for it being late- since I was given this book free in exchange for a review. Thank you James Renner and thank you to karen (no caps)- for providing it to me. This is a solid 3 star book!...but I did have a couple of reasons why I didn't add those extra stars that I will touch on later...but first let me sum up what this book is about.... February 9, 2004- Maura Murray disappeared off the face of the earth. Maura- a nursing student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst- left campus- packing her car, emailing her professors and work supervisor that she was taking a week off due to a family emergency. There was no family emergency. What there was, was a bunch of puzzles left behind to solve. On the surface a good student, a zest for life- with everything going for her- looks...smarts, a happy close knit family, a loving supportive fiance....a brilliant future ahead of her. The stuff people don't just leave behind... ...but the investigation of her disappearance- on a dark semi-isolated road uncovered- a drinking problem, possible family secrets, a pending court case, and maybe a not-so-perfect life. Was she taken??? Or did she disappear by choice? This is something we will never know- unless she is found someday...dead...or alive. So what did I have problems with? I am not a fan of internet -couch potato- sleuths... and Mr. Renner is not one of those. He goes out of his bubble to try to track down the story- but he does seem to have a respect for those who don't- that I have to disagree with. I think they do more harm than good- and their judgments make me cringe most times. Without all the facts you cannot- judge the situation...period. The other area I disagree with him on is even bigger...and concerns Maura Murray's family dynamics. James Renner cannot fathom a world in which a family would not welcome his \"help\"...and I have to completely smash his views on this... My family would not want you involved if I ever disappeared. I can guarantee it. It doesn't mean they don't love me. It means they would not want their life spewed over the unforgivable internet. It doesn't mean they are odd...it doesn't mean that they are suspicious or responsible for my death somehow or that they helped me disappear. It means they are private. That I am private. It means that there are things I wouldn't want everyone to know (I have not always lived the perfect life)...it means that there are things that THEY wouldn't want everyone to know about them (they have also lived a life not so perfect). Just because you don't mind the world knowing all of your baggage and your flaws- it doesn't mean that everyone lives in that same head space. Bravo!!!.... for letting the world into your secret (sometimes crazy) dark corners..but don't judge those....or become suspicious of those who don't want that same scrutiny. It doesn't mean they are uncaring. It just means what it means....and that is- They don't want the world let into their drama. I know in this day and age that seems foreign...but really it is kind of normal. One day, hopefully we will have all the answers- because Maura and her family deserve to have closure- and I for one think they alllllllllllllll deserve it...regardless of the fact of whether they cooperated with internet sleuths or people writing books. ...but even though I disagree with Mr. Renner on those two very BIG things. This was a book I can recommend wholeheartedly- regardless of our differences. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: So now we are finally able to become more personal with Agent Noah Bishop and again we are plunged into another small town where a serial killer resides. When Sheriff Miranda Knight reunites with her old lover, Bishop - walls slam up, tensions rise and there is no stopping these two from focusing on the case and ignoring the past. We learn that Bishop has formed a 'team' of extraordinary agents, agents with abilities no less and it was a terrific thriller throughout. The killer is a bit weird though, and I wasn't real satisfied with the ending. Kind of bland. Corpses were drained of blood, eyes gouged out, beatings. the MO was never consistent and the emotions of the killer was confusing. I seriously thought I was going to have to put this series away, but this novel has opened me up to the possibility of a marathon read on Bishop. Tall, dark, handsome and psychic to boot, but that was all I knew. I enjoyed this one more than the first two because it gives us a bit more information and history about Bishop and his past. This guy actually has feelings and a heart, yes! --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: This was one of my favorites so far in the Bishop/Special Crimes Unit books by Kay Hooper. I've enjoyed the series extremely. Unfortunately in my research to find more on this author, I think I have read these books out of chronological order. I hate when I do that, but it does explain some of the inconsistencies I encountered. More about Bishop is revealed including his past and his abilities. Sheriff Miranda Knight is introduced in this installment and she is quite the paranormal. Her talents are extraordinary. Her relationship with Bishop is fascinating to watch unfold. Of course, the relationship started long before this book, so here we are finding out what happens now. That can be quite fun. I think the dynamic between Miranda and Bishop was very entertaining. I would have liked to know more about their past. There are glimpses, but I was hungry for more details. I guess that's good writing - leaving you wanting more. The plot which Miranda and Bishop find themselves in is quite interesting. Despite the clues given the reader, I was surprised by the culprit. No spoilers here, though. All in all a very good read. I want more Bishop/SCU. Now on to the Evil series. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: I'm a big fan of the Bishop Special Investigations series, and I thought I'd read them all, so how I could have missed the book where Bishop's relationship with Miranda is explained, I can't imagine. However, I've read it now and it was really good!! Kay Hooper always does a great job of using \"hide in plain sight\" misdirection to distract you from the key pieces of information even as she gives you all the stuff you need to figure out the killers. I admit that I was caught completely by surprise when the killer in this story is unmasked. I didn't see it coming at all. The other thing Hooper is really good at is humanizing all her characters and getting the reader to strongly connect to, and care about all of them. Without giving any spoilers, there are some shocking things that happen to people you wouldn't expect in the course of the book, and there are moments when you really aren't certain whether all the main characters are going to make it out alive at the end. This book had a real ebb-and-flow rhythm that wasn't the usual constant build to a crescendo of a climax. Instead startling things happen, then the plot seems to settle a bit to lull you into a false sense of security before dropping you off an unexpected cliff as a new shock hits you. The eventual climax however, is very exciting and completely in keeping with the paranormal concept of the Bishop series, which is all I'm going to say. If you want more, you need to read the book, and I recommend that you do if you are a paranormal mystery fan. The other thing I especially liked about this one was the fact that we get to see a lot more of Bishop and learn more about who he was in his early years, and how those experiences, as well as his previous relationship with Miranda, have made him who he is now. In all the other books, Bishop seems just a mysterious psychic wunderkind who knows all and sees all, but you never get any of his back story. Well, his back-story is in this book and I think I will enjoy the other books more now that I know a little more of Bishop's past --> No translation was found using the current translator.

The story was good but not that exciting. Overall a decent read. I guess it would add the shock element for people not in the habit of reading crime thrillers but then not many people who aren't fans of crime thrillers would pick this up.

            "⚠ Translation error: I listened to the audiobook version of Savvy Summers and the Sweet Potato Crimes and overall, I really liked it. The narration had a unique, ethnic vibe that gave the story extra life — it felt authentic, especially with the Southern food references and Chicago setting. That alone made the audio format worth it. The short chapters made it super easy to follow along, and the pacing kept me engaged. The mystery itself had a fun twist — the way the men died (Viagra, of all things) definitely stood out and gave the plot something different. This is very much a cozy mystery, so it stays light in tone even with murder involved, and it leans heavily on character and setting over graphic details or intense suspense. What didn’t work as well for me was the fact that it’s told from only one point of view. I would’ve liked to hear from more characters to get a better feel for the story and community. With such a vibrant setup, it felt like a missed opportunity to dive deeper into other perspectives. Still, I’d definitely check out the next book if this turns into a series. Savvy is a solid character, and the cultural elements give it a refreshing twist on the cozy mystery genre --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: Savvy Summers will definitely fill you up with soul food & an overabundance of southern epithets! This cozy mystery was unique in its own way. I will admit, the pacing was slow for me. I also felt like I wasn't the targeted audience for this book. A lot of the cultural & social references were things I feel my mom (early 60's) would love, get & appreciate. For me, they were things I've (maybe?!..or not) heard of before, but ended up highlighting on my Kindle to get a little more background information, especially if it was meant as a joke. I had to remind myself that Savvy is older and these things reflect on her upbringing, as told throughout the book. I did enjoy how the location of her shop was located in the heart of Chicago, where people found comfort in food & company. There wouldn't be a mystery to solve without Savvy's loyal customers. As her Aunt Essie says, \"You do your best listening at mealtimes, 'cause that's when people do their best talking.\" How everything wrapped up in the end wasn't as I expected, since many people were suspects with different ties to each other & stories to tell. Thank you to NetGalley & St. Martin Press for the eARC of this book in exchange for my honest review. 🩷 --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: Dani and Ari first connected through Ari’s fanfic, which was a fun detail. Ari has no idea Dani is a famous tennis player. Their lives are very different but the connection is real and it was fun to watch them finally meet in person and see what could come of it. The plot took some predictable turns but it wasn’t bad for a debut. I’m starting to wonder if I’m no longer able to read New Adult. Ari and Dani were both sweet characters but they felt SO YOUNG to me. I mean, they are young but there was an immaturity there as well that's fine for characters in their early 20s but not necessarily what I want to read about. Ari’s worries about law school and her future career were reminiscent of when I got my MSW almost 20 years ago and that’s not really a period I like to revisit. I wish we’d gotten to read some of Ari’s fanfic or at least learn how it fits in with law school. Dani’s career as a pro tennis player was interesting and intense, even if I wish the story had explored other things about it. If you’re looking for a sports romance that’s on the fluffy side, this might be the one for you. Characters: Dani is a 23 year old Colombian lesbian tennis player. Ari is a 24 year old Mexican American lesbian law student, library worker, and fanfic writer. (I wondered if Ari might be demisexual but it’s not labeled on page.) This is set in Melbourne, Miami, Paris, NYC, Mallorca, and Virginia.

Croix Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/5 Spiciness rating: 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶/5 POV: Dual, first person Main Characters: Zoe & Ethan Genre: Sports Romance Tropes: opposites-attract; virgin heroine: player hero Review: Ethan is a famous soccer player who is only too happy to live life without romantic commitments and he has a reputation for it. Zoe is an attorney, who says is virgin because “she never had time” for it. She is also totally uptight and worries about everything, one of the main ones her reputation. Although being completely different, Ethan finds himself attracted to Zoe and decides to pursue her, the catch, she was representing him in a case. I really liked Ethan character because once he started pursuing Zoe he was super nice and dedicated to her, I didn’t feel the same from her. She seemed to be always on the verge of freaking out and needed to be reassured all the time. That’s the only reason the book wasn’t perfect to me. All the rest I liked. The story flows pretty well, the intimate scenes are quite hot and it was nice to read. I got the book for free on Amazon, you may want to check if it’s still available and give it a read. However, this is book three, maybe you’ll enjoy more starting from book one.

            "⚠ Translation error: Kay Hooper ties crime, romance, and paranormal together in the Bishop/SCU series. This particular book is the third of a mini series that the Bishop/SCU series consists of. The main character, Riley Crane, is a clairvoyant FBI agent assigned to the Special Crimes Unit under Noah Bishop. She was called by a friend to investigate a series of crimes in Opal Island. The book begins with her waking up with amnesia and proceeds with her trying to figure out what happened to her, what is going on on Opal Island, and find an assailant. There is a small romance in the novel as well as a twist when the assailant is reveal. Overall I feel Kay did an awesome job describing the characters and the plot of the story. There was a bit of \"extra\" information that could have been left out, but that just adds to the depth of the book I guess. Kay is a good writer to the point that the two books that prequel this novel do not need to be read in order for the reader to have an understanding of what's going on. That is a plus with Kay Hooper, you can read each of her novels as if they do not belong to a series. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: Riley Crane works for the Special Crimes Unit in the FBI with Noah Bishop. She's a chameleon, which means she can pretend to be anyone she needs to, as well as a clairvoyant. She's on vacation in South Carolina unofficially investigating some occult-appearing behaviors at the request of a former army buddy. She wakes up one morning covered in blood and with no memory of the past two weeks, including her very intense and passionate relationship with D.A. Ash Prescott. That same morning, a body is discovered, apparently killed in what looks like a Satanist ritual. Riley is called in by the local sheriff to investigate, but she has no memory of who any of these people are, except for flashes of memory and she's scrambling to piece together as much information as she can to hide her lack of memory. To top it off, she's unable to access her clairvoyance too. She'll have to figure out who she can trust and what's going on if she's to figure out what's happening to her mind, whose blood she was covered in and whose committing these occult-related crimes. This was pretty good. Very, very suspenseful. This jumps straight into the mystery and suspense as we follow Riley along on her day trying to figure out who the characters are and what the heck has happened to her. I mean, it's gotta be frickin strange to wake up and realize you've been living in a town for 2 weeks and have no memory of it. The author does a great job of conveying this without having Riley all-out panicking...she is after all, used to faking it to make it in her line of work, so she casually hides her memory loss and picks up clues as she goes. It was a very interesting concept and very well executed. And while this starts to get normal as Riley loses time once again and then you're really at a loss to what's happening...but then the author throws that twist at you when she remembers something happening and Ash says it never did. My brain kind of exploded at that moment realizing what a quagmire our heroine had gotten herself into...was Ash lying or was Riley's memory really that far gone. Wow. And as usual with this author, the villain is the least expected of them all and one you just didn't see coming especially given that we were privy to the internal monologues of this character and it never seemed to be possible . The romance here is especially intense and starts almost from the get-go. Upon entering the crime scene Riley realizes that she's having a sexual relationship with Ash Prescott and she has no trouble keeping it going because their chemistry is off the charts. And the author manages to convey it pretty well. Eventually, Riley trusts Ash with her problem and the connection between them grows on the page. This worked well because Ash had already been invested from the week or so before this story started, so I had no trouble buying into their relationship. I did kinda think the ending lacked some solid explanation of what the villain was doing to Riley's mind (was this person able to direct dark energy at her mind and decide what to do or was it just the effect of the dark energy?). Also, was it Ash and Riley's connection or some particular psychic ability on Ash's part that allowed Riley to overcome her barrier? That wasn't totally clear either...nor why Bishop would want to recruit him if he wasn't. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: Maybe to compensate for the lack the romantic relationship in the previous book in this series, here the heroine knows that she is involved with someone right from the beginning. Unfortunately she doesn't know who that might be because she wakes up with amnesia and covered in blood. After my complaints about the previous book I was a bit worried about starting this one. In Sleeping With Fear the SCU agent is a woman - Riley Crane. When the book starts she wakes up alone in her bed but covered in blood and with no memory of the previous weeks. She also seems to have lost her psychic abilities... Unsure about what has happened to her and who to trust Riley tries to hide her memory loss from everyone else. But the fact that she may have been involved in a crime and that she knows that she is in a relationship but not with whom will keep her guessing for a while. I really enjoyed this one. There was less psychic stuff going around and Riley is a sensible and level headed woman who does her best to discover what really is going on without the help of her paranormal gift. I wasn't totally happy with the final disclosure of who the bad guy is but I did like the step by step investigation and I even enjoyed the fact that Riley has to work alone when usually there are 2 SCU Agents working every case. I also liked the romantic plot. It was interesting to see how Riley dealt with the fact that she didn't remember her lover but, once she did find out who it was, didn't want to reveal that to him and had to cover for that. They certainly had an intense relationship and I was worried, for a bit, where Hooper was taking them. But I was quite happy with how she worked things out. I just thought the ending was a bit abrupt and I wasn't ready to close the book yet. Now I am wondering if they will show up in the next books of the series. It's one of the things I like best about series but Hooper hasn't let us see many glimpses of the past characters. Grade: 4/5 --> No translation was found using the current translator.

You may even find things that are missed or glossed over (i.e. I don't know if enough explanation of small sample size was given in Chapter 2), but in any case, the overall points the author makes are valid.

Yes, this makes the book slightly longer than necessary for sports fans who have a high level of economic competence, but overall, this a book you could give to somebody of any level of understanding - as long as they have interest in the subject matter and they will come away understanding it I would like to see the author's take on advertising, specifically how much of it is creeping into more and more of the sports fan's experience - surprisingly that wasn't a significant part of the book. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: From the quirky mind of Paul Oyer, this book was him at his curious best! Reminds me of why I was one of the few to enjoy his econ lectures in business school as much as I did (being featured on radiolab for his book about the economics of online dating forever left a mark of appreciation from me). I appreciated this book for what I appreciate about economists: the use of data and natural experiments to test assumptions and draw conclusions about correlation vs. causation with sports that are often contrary to \"story\" or \"conventional wisdom\" that humans attribute ignorantly for explanatory purposes so that the world can fit within the construct of our own biases. Memorable excerpts: Ch1 all about Kevin Durant. When does it make sense to train your kid to be a professional basketball player? 1) When he is already 6'8\" at age 15 - 0.01% of men born in any year will reach 6'8\" which is the average height in the NBA, equivalent to 45 out of 320,000. Of those 6'8\" or taller born in 1988 (like Durant), 8 had large NBA contracts, 21 had guaranteed contracts in the NBA, and many others spent time in the NBA or playing overseas. Height is hard to teach…. Durant had a statistically 18% chance to make a large NBA contract and 64% chance to make any contract in the NBA. Compound that with # 2) Given the institutional racism against black men… this was a good bet to take as compared to the probability-weighted returns of an alternative career. Interesting to learn that such a high percentage of black athletes in the NBA came from middle-class or above families (e.g. Jordan, Steph Curry, Kobe) rather than the rags to riches Lebron or AI story that we often associate. 2) Natural geography of Liechtenstein gives a territorial advantage to skiers. Given the very small size of the country, Liechtenstein's Olympic success is that of a country 7,718x its size. Similar to Kenya and Ethiopia who dominate marathons. There are 17 American men who have ever run under 2:10 in the marathon. There were 32 Kalenjin (East African tribe) men who did it in October 2011. High altitude, low barriers to entry for running led to a culture of running. Just like Czech Tennis players following the example of Martina Navratilova and Hewlett Packard at Stanford. Further examples of X-country skiing in Norway and golf among Korean women (note that Oyer refers to Taiwan as a country in this chapter) given their legacy of hard work and misogyny. \"Korea thus offers an interesting set of extremes: significant wealth and high savings alongside unhappy children and staggering gender inequality. This combination of attributes, it turns out, may be ideal for breeding world-class female golfers.\" [p38] Ch. 3 about cheating - prisoner's dilemma with PED… once one person does it everybody has to in order to keep up. Interesting to learn that cycling had a long history of cheating long before EPO… regarding the Tour de France: \"From the earliest days of the race, entrants drank to deaden the monotony, huffed ether to tamp down the pain, took amphetamines for stamina, or opiates to ease aches and cramps.\" The 1923 winner told a reporter, 'Cocaine to go in our eyes, chloroform for our gums, and do you want to see the pills?' [p42] Ch 4. about long-term contracts. Typically a star will take a 10% discount off his true value in exchange for more guaranteed years. Ch 5. On penalty kicks and Nash Equilibria - 65% chance of scoring is consistent whether kicking left or right considering the chance of a keeper guessing the right direction / probability of scoring based on the footedness of the kicker, and chance of saving it. Interestingly Oyer did not talk in this chapter about the benefit of kicking it straight down the middle but nobody does it for fear of looking bad in case it doesn't work. Like Russell Wilson throwing the interception at the 1yard line against the Patriots instead of handing off to Marshawn Lynch on 1st down… Pete Carroll's play call may have been right but the result failed. Do you make decisions to win or to not look bad? Ch 6. About the social value of scalpers and sports betting. Singapore's policy about charging residents to enter Marina Bay Sands but foreigners are free… makes sense at first until you realize that residents are able to use online gambling sites for free which \"makes one wonder if Singapore is fine with letting poor people gamble but doesn't want them doing it in sight of tourists\" [p144] --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: A good basic intro to some fundamental economic concepts as applied to sports, and especially useful if you haven't explored the literature that fully. There's the semi-randomized PK bit, already covered in Soccernomics , along with connections to, say, pitch selection, which provides a very rudimentary grounding in this area--but given the amount of data out there about how much entire pitch sequences, within games and within whole seasons, are recorded and analyzed, and then replayed with new nuances later in the season, surely there could have been a lot more complexity in the discussion of just how often these games are iterated and how knowledge of the other player's knowledge complicates your choice. Same for the economics of getting the Olympics or World Cup (bad), though a bit more detail here and discussion of how the only public agreement to full blank checks recently has been in and around Dallas. My favorite part, having played a minuscule part in the scalping economy when I sold my football tickets to the scalpers hanging around outside the student union in Ann Arbor as a sophomore (you could get $50 for MSU or Notre Dame or Ohio State tickets, which paid for your entire package), was the history and theory of organized secondary-market ticket brokerages, their getting crowded out by StubHub and other institutionally-connected agencies, and the comparison to airplane tickets, which the leagues are apparently in the process of trying to make game tickets into. So a solid starting point if you're interested in these questions and haven't dug into this material at great length or breadth. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: Confession time: I've always detested reading short stories. Oh sure, there are exceptions - compilations such as 2014's FaceOff ,\" penned by many of my favorite mystery/thriller authors and MatchUp ,\" ditto (the latter edited, not insignificantly, by this author, who also co-wrote a short story with another favorite author, Kathy Reichs, for that book). But on the whole, if there are fewer than 300 words I don't even bother. The author, too, used to be something of a stranger to short stories (not that he avoided them - he was just too busy writing other things). It was the 1997 success of his still-popular Jack Reacher series, he says in the introduction to this book, that introduced him to short story writing - at the time, a novel concept for an (ahem) novelist. Asked to write a short story, his first, he came up with one for an anthology - then another, then another and another and so on. The collection here, he explains, is his \"editor's pick\" of the litter. That brings us to now, when I requested and happily received a pre-release copy of this collection in exchange for a review (an honest one, honest)! And despite my misgivings about short stories, I found I can be swayed; in fact, given the entries here, it was pretty darned easy. Each one seemed to be more enjoyable than the one before it - well, at least till I got to the next to the last one, which I liked least of all (still good, though). They're all exceptionally well crafted and clever as well as exceptionally brief - I read the entire book in not much over a couple of hours, in fact. I know that because I read almost nonstop - that's how much I enjoyed what to me used to be unenjoyable. Alas, what I can't do is provide details on the stories themselves; their brevity means nothing noteworthy can be extracted without giving away too much (in review language, that means no spoilers allowed). So I'll be brief as well; I loved this book and I think you will, too. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: This book reminded me why I don't like funny books. More often than not I find them annoying, and so unfortunately was the case with this book. But most of all, this book is wordy. From beginning to end, it is filled with a whole lot of unnecessary dialogues that try very hard to be funny. To such an extent that they become unbearable. I was by a whisker away from not finishing this book because I was fed up with those silly jokes and endless conversations. It's been a long time since I met such an annoying hero as Finn. Being in his head is a chore. This guy can't be serious at all. I couldn't wait for him to finally shut up. I know his gaiety is supposed to cover his uncertainty and fear, but I couldn't find any sympathy for him. This kid is so annoying! Worse, Marcus, who I liked at the beginning, was starting to turn into some kind of copy of Finn too! Marcus is quite an underdeveloped character. We don't know much about him, about his past, feelings and character. And this despite the fact that part of the story is from his perspective. Unfortunately, a pile of jokes cannot hide the rather weak plot. Although maybe that isn't even it. It's just that the action slows down a lot because of all the dialogues and jokes. At times when you sit waiting for what will happen, Finn has to show off his questionable eloquence. Most of the time, I just waited for Finn to shut up so the story could finally move on. This, unfortunately, also applies to sex scenes. I can't believe I'm saying this, but the sex scenes are waffly! Even at this point, we have to listen to a whole bunch of silly jokes. As a result, these scenes are completely devoid of climate. There is simply no chemistry between Finn and Marcus, both in and out of bed. To be honest, it's hard for me to even find any feelings between them. Why are they interested in each other? I'm not sure. One might consider that they share this primitive sense of humor, but the author does not suggest such thing. I'm not sure if Finn and Marcus even like each other, whether or not they're talking about love. Their feelings are kind of flat. In over 350 pages of this book, there is not enough space to solve the case of the vampire who hounded Finn. Which, in fact, is not that weird considering the amount of space devoted to non-funny jokes. But I'm not curious at all. I doubt I'd endure another 300 pages in Finn's head. This is my first and last book in this series. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

Now on to book 2!! Reread/Relisten #1: December 2020 Still love it as much as the first time. I listened to the audio book and man it made it so much better. Michael Ferraiuolo is perfect for all of Alice Winters books. He did the Hitmans Guide and that was perfection .

This book reminded me so much of The Hitman's Guide to Making Friends and Finding Love , and I am not mad about it. I think the reason I didn't give it the full 5 stars was because, there was a bit of a lull for me in the middle of the book. I feel like either something big should have happened or those pages should have been shorter since it was a little bit of filler.

Susie Owens shines as the protagonist, grappling with her creative block and feelings for the charismatic yet reserved Adam Daniels.

            "⚠ Translation error: This is a review of the entire series. Cut from a titan's stomach after his cultist mother was eaten alive when he was still growing inside her womb, Kuklo bore the cursed reputation of being the son of a titan. He was locked in a cage as a toddler and treated as a circus freak to be paraded around. After years of abuse on the streets he was sold to the Inocencio royal family to become the plaything of their cruel son Xavi. Never taught how to speak or shown the love of another human being, Kuklo's life seemed destined to meet a gloomy end. That was until Sharle, the daughter of the Inocencio family visits him in his cell one fateful night and teaches him the warmth of another person. Before the Fall takes a very different approach to storytelling than the main series. The high stakes action, intricate world-building, thrilling political undertones, masterful use of mystery and foreshadowing aren't really anywhere to be seen here. That's not to say the prequel is bad, it just tells a much more personal and self-contained narrative that serves to flesh out the lesser explored elements of the main series such as who was the first person to ever kill a titan, how the survey corps were formed and how the three dimensional odm gear they use to kill titans was invented. The star of the manga in my opinion was Sharle. She threw away a life of luxury and safety to save Kuklo and rebel against the cruelty of her own royal family. She constantly puts herself in danger to confront the horrors of the titans, corrupt royals and rogue criminals. She uses her well-educated background to enlist herself in the service of a group of underground blacksmiths in order to improve their methods and create the technological foundation of the military gear that would go on to give humans a fighting chance against the titans. She was the backbone of the whole narrative and her influence had the biggest impact on the events of the main series. If not for her efforts, none of the characters in the main series would've ever had the means to survive. I also just really enjoyed her personality, the way she never discriminates against the lesser class and how she breaks free from the chains of her royal upbringing. Kuklo was a decent character, but after he meets Sharle he mostly just feels like a generic Shounen protagonist. He's not bad, just mundane and doesn't really fit in with the overall complex cast, especially next to the secondary protagonist Sharle who ended up accomplishing so much. Some of the world-building doesn't line up with the main series such as titans being able to walk at night and them disappearing the second they're killed, but most of the inconsistencies were minor things that weren't enough to completely destroy the immersion. The limited scope of the plot and setting also made the pacing feel somewhat tedious at times because most of the drama is never taken beyond the walls of the cities, but it also made room for more personal time between the characters living out their daily lives together and really learning to put their heads together to help form a better world for humanity's last survivors. Not nearly as good as the main series and it doesn't add that much to the world or overall story, but it's an enjoyable side story that gives you a better understanding of the basics regarding daily life in the walled cities and how the foundations of military power and titan-fighting capabilities came to be. It probably won't appeal to casual readers of the series, but it might be worth checking out if you're already a diehard fan of Attack on Titan. *** My Social Media My YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPPs...

Before WW2, a spinal cord injury meant a very short, bedridden life. But when doctors started treating the injuries as something to rehabilitate, they found that using sports like wheelchair basketball worked wonders both for the vets' physical and mental health. The book walks us through the medical advancements in spinal cord injury rehab; the development of wheelchair sports that eventually led to things wheelchair divisions in marathons and the Paralympics; and how the playing tours of these athletes helped advance the disability rights movement. As a sports fan and the mother of a wheelchair-using kiddo, I found the whole thing immensely interesting and will probably be recommending it to everyone I know who has an interest in disability rights, veterans, medicine, rehabilitation, sports, and human beings.

Large amounts of corporate and institutional support. Who did wheelchair basketball teams play mostly at the beginning? Nondisabled basketball club teams who they beat up regularly kind of like power soccer players do when we put nondisabled players in our chairs. Where did most of the original players meet? In hospitals while recovering from injuries sustained in World War II. On an organizational, financial, and strategic level, I think this book provides an interesting retrospective that anyone involved in adaptive sports could learn from. The stories of the individual players were interesting, and, just like anything else, developing a movement relies on the personalities who are excited about promoting it. However, just because of the way my mind works, I was particularly drawn to the proliferation of wheelchair basketball teams and how that compares and contrasts with the development of my own sport of power soccer. This book is definitely worth reading. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: Beginning with the humanity of each man in the sports, progressing through graphic descriptions of the inhumanity forced upon them by war, to the cultural ignorance and effective ostracism by their fellow Americans, this book goes on to describe their heroic efforts AFTER the war. The paramedical community did the best they could for the time, but it was each man's own determination that brought him through to refuse to be defeated. Together they organized team sports and the early incarnation of the Paralympic Games which includes amputees, accident sufferers, and those whose lives have been changed by diseases like polio, from countries around the world. This is a complex narrative of survival, resilience, and triumph for athletes, history buffs, military veterans, and people with and without disabilities, backed up by factual memories of the early pioneers of the movement. This is definitely a story of real bravery too long forgotten! Read it if you dare. I requested and received a free ebook copy from Center Street, a division of Hachette Book Group via NetGalley.

            "⚠ Translation error: I adored this first book in a new sports series. Charlotte (Lottie) is a high school math teacher and Andrew is a starting pitcher for a local baseball team, although his career is near its end. A top-secret dating app matches them and with its near 100% accuracy, it’s anyone’s guess if the deal breaker will make this couple or break them up forever. These characters are so wonderful. Lottie is so carefree with her ready smile and fun personality, while Andrew just wants to be liked for himself and not his money or fame. He’s so sweet and thoughtful, taking care to forge this path gently. I love that their dogs get along so well too. Padgett does a great job of incorporating the challenges to this potential relationship, while maintaining the obvious chemistry that exudes in every interaction. It’s also beautiful to see the way faith and religion play an integral part to the solidness of this duo’s foundation, although it is a minor part. And honestly, it was hard not to swoon with each text, run-in, date, and reason to banter. I love the hints that leave doors cracked for possible future installments in the Southern Sports Sweethearts series. This is a set for any sports or romance lover.

            "⚠ Translation error: One of the things Bakuman has going for it is its ensemble cast. I've always liked ensembles for the wider variety of stories they let you tell. And you know what's the mark of a story that's utilizing its ensemble cast to its fullest potential? Mixing up the character interactions. Right now Bakuman has a large cast but they tend to talk to their own particular groups exclusively. Which fine sure, I obviously talk more with my close friends or colleagues than everyone I know but still. Mix it up! The plot has a golden opportunity right now with the Readers Fest competition. Mashiro wants to compete, Miss Akina's looking for an artist. Instead of overloading Akito with three mangas running concurrently why not pair them up? They've barely interacted so far so it would be new ground! And there's already story tensions built in vis-a-vis her rivalry with Akito. I'd also vote for Miho VA-ing Akina's series on the same grounds but Ohba already shut that one down. :( Obviously Miho's career has to be dependant on Mashiro's. I mean it's not like the readers could possibly be interested in learning more about her outside of her role as the love interest? Or that any of them are disappointed in the relatively narrow track this series has taken wrt to the manga industry when just bothering to expand her character would have let us see another side of production with voice acting? Man every time I try to review a Bakuman volume my critiques always basically boil down to it would be 1000 times better if Ohba could pretend to care about the girls for more than two minutes. So many wasted potential storylines! It's like a case study in the ways sexism is actively debilitating to stories, like I can't just take off my feminist glasses because my basic interesting-storylines glasses see the same thing. 3 stars --> No translation was found using the current translator.

This dark academia romance is next level. It’s full of mystery, lies, secrets, murder and betrayal and starts off with a bang right from the beginning. Chapter two has a trigger warning, setting the dark stage for the remainder of the book. As you go through the book, each chapter captures your attention more, dragging you into the suspense and making you question yourself. Every character you meet is one you’ll be asking yourself about and taking notes on. Just when you think you have something figured out, Luna hits you with something else to throw you off. Another detail in the story gets revealed, and you’re truly saying, “What the heck?!? I didn’t see that coming!” Like all of Luna’s books, it’s dark, and nothing is ever what it seems. So, you’ll constantly be on the edge of your seat, wondering what’s next. Nico and Shiloh’s story is beautifully illustrated with twisted chaos. I can’t wait for the next book.

            "⚠ Translation error: In dark, backward times such as these, a collection of gay mischief short stories is just what I need! Lots of top-tier queer authors included. I'm especially excited to read new Alissa Nutting. Let's jump right in! Myriam Lacroix - The Meaning of Life LOL! When a lesbian couple discover a baby stuffed in an old couch in a bar alley, they decide to adopt him without following legal protocol. Wild from the first word, non-stop wit throughout. Hilarious and even a little poignant by the end. I'm given an instant sense of belonging with this story. Straights can stop in and have a good time, but you probably won't get all the jokes and self-deprecating humor. Still, anyone should be able to agree this is one of the tightest, wittiest, and most enjoyable short stories ever. If the rest are even half this good, this book is gonna be a blast! Update: On further inspection, it looks like this story was adapted, or excerpted from, Lacroix's novel How It Works Out. While perfect as a short story, I'm definitely going to check out this novel to see what happens next. Soula Emmanuel - It's A Cruel World for Empaths Like Us Dissatisfied with the ongoings of humdrum life, our protagonist makes false threat calls just to watch employees empty out onto the street, freed from their daily grind however briefly. With this story, the editors move us away from witty gags and into literary somberness. It's a good example of the range this collection is prepared to offer. The second person point of view is well-crafted to strip away any implication of gender. The story itself is a genderless one, filled with the kind of morose existence we can all relate to. Overall, while I appreciate the artistic delivery, this story is a bit of a downer. I look forward to continued diversity in delivery and tone of future stories, though. Next! Temim Fruchter - Redistribution A surprisingly effective thematic connection between income inequality and relationship inequality. There's something mesmerizing, and highly relatable, about watching the broken-hearted poor indulge themselves in the empty home of the wealthy. The queer aspect is very muted, but bubbles under the surface as added oppression. I like this one a lot! SJ Sindu - Wild Ale An all-too-real revisit to Covid times, domestic squabbles and retail therapy. All seems lost, but a rumble against the MAGA crowd unexpectedly brings back hope. Well-written enough to remind me of 2020 trauma. A bit of humor at the end to make it fun. Alissa Nutting - Peep Show Yes! It’s been too long since Nutting’s last novel and I couldn’t wait to read this story. Did it disappoint? Not at all! Just as wild as we’ve come to expect from the author of unhinged classics like Tampa and Made for Love . When a lesbian steals the dog from her tech bro boss’s home, she begins to suspect the seemingly-alive dog is actually a spy camera watching her have sex. The hotter her girl-on-girl action is, the more promotions she seems to get at work. It’s a premise for the ages, managing to encapsulate numerous modern anxieties all at once. The only disappointment is that we don’t get 300 pages of this insanity, or a proper resolution to the mystery. I can only hope this is actually an excerpt of a novel-in-progress because I desperately want to read more! Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya - Of Course, A Curse A cursed hat and a pickpocket girlfriend places Naya in a surreal state of existence. Surprisingly relatable even with the fantasy element. Aurora Mattia - Wild and Blue Overly ethereal, I think, but another good showcase of dexterity. Maybe that should have been the theme--the impressive literary range of queer writers. Not seeing the \"queer chaos\" theme so much in this one. Next! Anna Dorn - Bad Dog Ooh! Now we're back on theme. Lots of bad gays in this one. Notably near-identical twin sisters, both with their own psychological issues. The extra \"bad\" one decides to impersonate the other to try to break off her engagement to an annoying woman whose main fault is loving dogs. The trick goes about as well as you would expect. Overall, a great story with characters who jump off the page and grow more complex with every paragraph. Super cute and definitely on brand for this anthology. Mac Crane - Two Hundred Channels of Conflict Watching another queer couple through their window, scrutinizing body language to decipher their level of happiness. Replying to wrong number text messages and fantasizing about another life. Going on random date --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: In a Nutshell: A anthology of “gay crime” stories. The queer content was decent but the crime content left me somewhat dissatisfied. Also, the R-rated content and language in many stories wasn’t to my reading taste. So this collection wasn’t my cup of tea, though I did find a few gems herein. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The moment I saw that amazing punny title, I knew that I would have to get my hands on this collection. Seeing gay + crime within the same title stoked all embers of my curiosity. The fact that the book was included in the GR Reading challenge for Pride reads was the icing on the cake. However, the expectations created by the title were met only to some extent. This anthology has sixteen stories, each of which feature an LGBTQIA+ character and a crime. Sounds like a fun combo, right? But it doesn’t exactly work that way. Thanks to the contributing authors coming from varied backgrounds, we get a nice diverse experience with stories being set in different locations from multiple countries. However, in terms of characters, the queer diversity is missing. A majority of the stories had only lesbians in the lead, with one story featuring an (implied) trans character. I’d have expected more colours of the rainbow to be represented adequately. The crime content was also much tamer than what I had thought. A word like “crime” conjures up expectations of murders and heists and kidnappings. But most of the crimes in this collection barely touch the murkier end of the criminal spectrum, as they contain relatively petty transgressions such as prank calls, fraudulent participation in contests, and tales of vengeance. If you are looking for darker and bloodier offences, you might be disappointed. This doesn’t mean that the stories aim at a younger audience such as YAs. On the contrary, more than half of the stories have explicit sexual content or vulgar language, both of which aren’t to my reading taste. In a book about crimes, I didn’t expect to see so many open-door steamy scenes, most of which were totally unrelated to any crime and hence superfluous for the plot. The writing style also was a mixed experience for me. Some stories were genuinely funny in an ironic sort of manner. Many had quirky characters and quirkier plots. But quite a few stories contained flashbacks, which broke the main narrative flow. Some had too many characters, while some others had too many subplots. Reading these stories felt like an endless trudge towards nowhere and the percentage indicators on my Kindle just wasn’t moving upwards quickly enough, despite this being a relatively short book at just 260-odd pages. After a point, I was so frustrated that I even contemplated DNFing the book. But I don’t DNF easily, and my persistence was rewarded in the second half, which had some really creative tales. The characters save my experience to some extent. It is rare for contemporary books to depict a member of the LGBTQIA+ community as flawed; the idealised portrayal of homosexual relationships in Queer fiction is not just repetitive but also misleading. So such storytelling feels novel and refreshing. Most stories don’t have likeable leads, which is quite obvious from the title. But their flaws and their vulnerabilities enhance the impact. As always, I rated the stories individually. To my regret, a major chunk of the book didn’t work well for me. Of the sixteen stories, only five stories reached/crossed the 4-star mark. The remaining eleven stories went all the way from 1 star to 3.5 stars, creating a shaky reading experience. These are my top favourites with 4+ stars each. 🏳️‍🌈 The Meaning of Life - Myriam Lacroix: No way would I have been able to predict the direction of this story. Weird yet wonderful. - ⭐⭐⭐⭐ 🏳️‍🌈 Redistribution - Temim Fruchter: Witty concept. I would have rated it higher if it had continued for at least a scene more. - ⭐⭐⭐⭐ 🏳️‍🌈 Peep Show - Alissa Nutting: Didn't expect the title would be literal. Might have rated this higher had the steamy content been more to my comfort level. - ⭐⭐⭐⭐ 🏳️‍🌈 Bad Dog - Anna Dorn: Can dogs be bad or are they simply dogs belonging to bad owners? This hilarious story explores this question and much more. - ⭐⭐⭐⭐ 🏳️‍🌈 Grand Beaver Cabin - Emily Austin: This is the kind of story I picked up this book for. It was perfect in terms of plot, characters, and theme. - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ All in all, I had hoped for a memorable experience given that amazing title, but I guess it wasn’t to be.

            "⚠ Translation error: A Delightful And Real Love Story, Chance And Sam's Chemistry Scorches! The Danger And Suspense Are Sometimes More Convenient Than Realistic. Samantha Carter, twenty-six, is happy to begin her new job as team massage therapist for the L.A. Wildcats. Although she has no remaining family, she descends from a family of healers dating back two hundred years. Helping others is programmed into her DNA, so it comes as no surprise to her that she has been told she has magic hands. This job is Sam's lucky break after her disastrous first attempt at a job as a massage therapist in Las Vegas six months ago. She had been naive to accept that job, and it cost her dearly. She wishes she hadn't needed to leave her friends in Las Vegas behind, but thank goodness she was alerted by a co-worker that she had been blamed for the raid on the establishment the next day. She had learned from her past mistake, though. This was a legit job and she had researched the players when she got hired on. Yet as ornery as she expected Chance Adams to be, she certainly hadn't considered that she would immediately find herself in the same situation that ended her first job. This time she just had to find a way deal with it professionally. Chance Adams, twenty-six, is a real American hero living the American dream. He has wanted to play football his entire life and is one of the few walk-ons to make the team instead of being drafted. Today the Wildcats quarterback with the runaway ego is a household name. He was orphaned when he was young and served eighteen months in Afghanistan before he completed college. He joined the Wildcats three years ago, along with his best friend and fellow war vet David Tarryron, wide receiver. But while David is happily married with children, Chance is a perpetually DTF playboy. Chance and Sam's first encounter is a total disaster. Chance later realizes that things are falling apart for him, and traces the cause back to his session with Sam. With some guidance from David, Chance begins to understand the error of his ways and recognizes that he is lonely despite all the women he surrounds himself with. Chance and Sam's romance is thoughtful and sweet. Chance doesn't hesitate to commit to doing what he has to in order to get what he wants. He changes overnight from obnoxious flirt to patient suitor. Sam has to learn to trust Chance's intentions, as well as to allow herself to just relax and enjoy life. With Chance, Sam learns to feel confident and comes out of her shell. The shy girl is replaced with a flirty woman. Chance has considerable stamina, so their chemistry drips off the page. It is not surprising he is into PDA! Their story alone is delightful and feels real, but there is an element of danger and suspense added to the mix which ramps up all their feelings and emotions. The end provides a lovely HEA that is well-deserved! Chance and Sam's story is a fairly easy read. It is nicely written, with just a few proofing errors and a brief confusing passage. The POV alternates between Chance and Sam, with a few passages thrown in from Michael and Eizo DiLucca. The plot is nicely developed with an element of suspense. Although he claims to have great intuition, Chance's suspicion and his reaction to it still seem extreme. Some of this part of the story feels more convenient than realistic, but not so much that it ruins the story as a whole. The characters are very well-defined given the length. It is easy to fall in love with Chance and Sam. Chance is swoon-worthy! Sam did appear to be out of character, though, when she was a little too eager to please her new girlfriends - speaking too openly and drinking when she doesn't have a history of drinking. The supporting characters are enjoyable as well. Morgan and David are great. I rate this book four stars.

Alors qu’elle se trouvait en classe, une brèche étrange s’est ouverte. Tous ses autres camarades ont commencé à se dématérialiser sous ses yeux. Elle a ressenti une grande douleur, puis… Plus rien ! Quand elle reprend connaissance, elle ne voit rien autour d’elle. Elle a comme l’impression d’être coincé dans quelque chose. On l’aurait enlevé ? Non, rien de tout ça. En essayant de s’échapper de là où elle se trouve, elle va se rendre compte que c’était un œuf et qu’elle vient d’éclore. Elle est en réalité une araignée. Pourtant, elle ne va pas être au bout de ses peines. Car elle va rapidement se rendre à l’évidence qu’elle n’est pas dans son monde à elle. En plus de ça, elle acquière des compétences et des niveaux… Comme dans un RPG ! J’ai bien aimé ce premier tome qui nous introduit bien l’univers. Le personnage est plutôt seul pour l’instant, mais je ne doute pas qu’à l’avenir elle va se faire des alliés bien atypique ! L’humour est présent et c’est vraiment pour moi le point fort de ce premier tome. Certes, il y a un peu d’action, mais pour l’instant, ce n’est pas non plus des choses folles. Il ne faut pas oublier qu’elle n’est pour l’instant qu’une simple araignée de niveau 1, il ne faut pas non plus lui en demander beaucoup. ^^’ En bref, ce premier tome est vraiment prometteur. En plus, dans beaucoup d’Isekai de réincarnation que j’ai lue, le personnage principal est souvent un homme. Cela est rafraîchissant d’avoir une femme. En plus, j’aime beaucoup l’humour dont elle fait preuve. Hâte de voir ce que la suite de ce manga pourra nous réserver ! --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: This book is rated Teen and even though it has some violence between monsters and some spider cannibalism I think it will be okay for younger readers if they are interested in the book. Having read titles like \"Re:Monster\" and \"That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime\" this book follows a similar formula of average person either dies or in the case of this book go digital possibly then end up in an alternative magical world that is very videogame like including skills that can be taught and learned. Unlike the other two books mentioned above this one comes off kinda weak because while the girl turned spider basically trying to survive in a strange new world she comes off as the only one that seems smart enough to do what she does because she still has her memories from her previous life (unless you count the human dungeon delvers but they don't talk to her. ) Being a first volume I have hope that she might meet other students turned monster (though if they were all turned spider they were probably eaten) or at least finds some kind of allies since this solo adventure feels like some strange monologue telling us her plans to survive from only her point of view. That being said the book is not a complete snoozefest and even had some amusing moments. One of my favorite moments is her over confidence after defeating an Elroe Ferect and hears another just to find out it was not one but many swarming. You will believe spiders can run. :) --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

This book and \"Your Black Friend.. And Other Strangers\" have made me an anarchist (or at least attempting to be one). This book was published in Feb. 2020, which is so wild as it was published in that strange sweet post-pandemic freedom. It was also published in a pre-abolitionist uprising world. With all the crazy worldwide things that have been happening since this book was published, it's incredibly timely and strangely accurate to our current situation. I highly recommend reading this and as much Passmore as possible.

            "⚠ Translation error: A wildly drawn, speculative ‘satire’ on the relationship between sports, race, fandom and protest. Passmore - the artist behind BTTMFDRS - throws a cast of protestors into a ‘sports riot’ amidst a blackout, using the moments of light inside the darkness (visually and metaphorically) to draw damning (and hilarious) connections between our love of sports and systemic racism. It’s a short, powerful read and Passmore’s mildly unhinged artwork is beautifully soaked in pitch black and shades of brown. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: I couldn't comment on Ryan's post since we're not friends, but want to share why I don't think he has fully thought out his attack against the author's opinions. Ryan posts about section 936, which allowed companies to essentially keep money in tax free Puerto Rico and then move that money out to the US at will. He thinks that the author has a \"hilarious\" contradicting view that 936 was both horrible and the absence of 936 was even worse - making the author an idiot. Ryan, I don't think you understood the author's point. 936 did bring a lot of manufacturing to the island yes, but it also explicitly set the island's economy to be ripe for exploitation. 936 helped make the economy become an even bigger tax haven for companies and nothing more, which created a house of cards. He writes that both party leaders in Puerto Rico were afraid of 936 AND the absence of 936. They knew that 1. 936 brought money but 2. it showed that PR economy was a scam, based only on investors avoiding taxes and wanting cheap labor. 70% of PR production was foreign owned - natives never really had a say or chance in the game, hence showing how 936 was really only helping the big guy. So when Clinton got rid of 936 and NAFTA started, the house of cards fell down - because again, the only reasons companies 'invested' in the island was to avoid taxes (none of their profits went into the actual puerto rican communities). So yes, 936 good and yes 936 bad. Undeniable that the US set up Puerto Rico to be exploited, and not just with 936 --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: This book is such a good overview of how US settler coloniality has shaped life on the island of Puerto Rico. The information is thorough and compelling. However, the reason I rated this book lower is because I did not think the storytelling was great. That is, the writing at times was dense, and felt like moving through quick-drying cement. Because of this, I think Morales missed opportunities to tell certain stories through a better narrative arc. I also found some chapters to have a more reporter tone (here is what happened, and here is what happened next, and then next), which shares facts, but doesn’t stitch them together to tell a story. In other words, the broader tapestry of what has always been happening since the US settled Puerto Rico was left to the reader to piece together. That said, Morales’ critiques were spot-on, and I feel his commentary on the radical nature of University of Puerto Rico students, faculty, and staff was fantastically interesting (I wish he would have done more there, to be honest). --> No translation was found using the current translator.

The book showed in detail the legal forces required to remove an innocent man from death row. It is all about what you can prove in court. The complexity of the American legal system is illustrated. Moreover, the unrelenting and consistent drives of all the people involved are highlighted: prosecutors and defending attorneys; the police; the judges, the huge relevance of prior legal judgements and all ancillary personal. I realise some reviewers have thought the book was slow going in the middle. I disagree the legal convolutions were a necessary part of the story.

He has the ability to find drama in the most minute points of law which makes it lively and lifts him into a league of his own when it comes to legal fiction.

And lo, against all odds, Squirrel, who confessed to murdering three people, may actually be innocent, and framed. Turow is a master of character, and it was the portrayl of Arthur Raven and a former judge, Gillian Sullivan, that I found thrilling.

Instead of bravado and macho bullshit you've got geniuine pain, and crumbled lives (she's an addict, he cares for a mentally-ill sister). The grace of the novel was in the ache of them both as they tried to merge their lives while preserving themselves in case it doesn't work. It was unexpected and authentic. However, I wasn't invested in Rommy's case, nor did I care about all the time spent with the opposing counsel. Because of this, I'll designate the novel to three stars.

Great character development is the key to his success IMHO. All the twists, although subtle, were still jarring. I also loved the ending. My only complaint and other authors do this as well (especially John LeCarre), is this: They introduce a ton of different characters in their books. Each character is then are referred to by their first name, often their last name and in Scott's Case - the antagonist even had a bloody nickname. Squirrel! It's hard enough early on in the book to keep track of everybody but when they get three names each, your 20 characters become 60! That's too bloody weight to carry!

            "⚠ Translation error: Between Two Kingdoms is the fabulously well written memoir of Suleika Jaouad.  Some readers may recognise her name from her Life, Interrupted column which was syndicated in numerous newspapers and magazines across America. This was a captivating book, both devastating and uplifting in equal measures.    Devastating because it tells of her cancer diagnosis at just 22 years of age, of the toll this disease took not just on her life but on the lives of her family, friends and the ways it negatively impacted a beautiful relationship.   Uplifting because despite all of those things she was a survivor struggling to pick up where life left off.   When she was beginning to succumb to depression she instead dusted herself off and regained control of her life and took steps to actively re-engage in life and to live it in a more positive manner. There are not too many people whose lives are untouched in some way by cancer.  Not necessarily themselves but perhaps a work colleague, friend or family member.   It's a torturous ordeal for the patient and stressful for loved ones.    Suleika's story makes that blindingly obvious and highly relateable.   The suffering is not only physical though that's dreadful enough.   It's also pyschologically damaging, particularly when you're only 22 and continuously having near death experiences.    Suleika speaks openly and eloquently about her sense of loss, her resentment and the envy she felt towards those still living their lives and moving forward.  She writes of anger, of pain and of fear.     She admits to huge bouts of guilt at the financial burden she placed upon her parents on one hand and the pressure upon her brother to become a bone marrow donor on the other.  She made clear just how sad it was to make beautiful new friendships with other young cancer patients only to lose them and to then have to arrange their memorials. Each one of those factors made it hard to read Suleika's story. Possibly even more than all of those things I was saddened about the way the disease wreaked havoc on the beautiful relationship between Suleika and her boyfriend Will.   Suleika wrote with honesty and tenderness about the way Will took on the carer role and the sacrifices he made in his own life, the toll it took on him personally and professionally, and eventually the ways and reasons their relationship failed.   Though she was resentful and had clearly been angry, she eventually worked through her feelings and though she still loved him she was adult enough to acknowledge the ways she had been responsible for the ultimate failure of that relationship.   Her book had the feel of an ode to Will wrapped in an apology of sorts. Post disease, not only was Suleika a new person in the sense of her changed DNA (thanks to her bone marrow transplant) but she needed to make a new life for herself, to figure out who she was now, what was important to her and how she could live within the physical limitations of her body.   Instead of remaining mired in the difficulties of living, of dwelling on how life was not what she hoped and planned it to be, now that she had technically survived, Suleika forced herself to make some changes.    In this spirit she embarked upon a 100 day roadtrip taking in 33 states meeting up with twenty of the people (strangers) whose words and thoughts helped sustain her during her cancer battle.   This was inspiring and showed the true grit Suleika had demonstrated throughout her illness. I cannot be more thankful to Jess from Penguin Random House for the invitation to read this tremendously moving memoir.    Thank you too to NetGalley for making this possible.  Finally my congratulations and thanks to Suleika for sharing her inspiring story. I wish her every happiness for her future and decades of good health to follow. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: I am not sure why this memoir is so highly rated. I kept waiting for real personal growth, a moral to the story, an epiphany, something... anything... but the book is 2/3 graphic cancer treatment, 1/3 chasing after a boy, if not in action, then in thought. One page of actual reconciliation just wasn't enough for me. I think there were a lot of missed opportunities to connect with the world around her. I dont even know why she bothered talking about the road trip. It could have been so much more compelling, if she cared about anyone or anything besides herself and her relationship status. Many of the characters are very one dementional. They are obviously real people so it's kind of disappointing to see them presented in such a way. Perhaps if she had scaled back on describing every single cancer treatment and instead described some more of the late night conversations with Max, we would have gotten to know more about him as a person and his impact on her battle with cancer. Instead we settle for two or three paragraphs at the end of the book. Her brother was obviously struggling, but she doesn't describe any conversations they had or how she might have thanked him. There were quite a few other things that annoyed me about this book. She has the habit of using a big word, and then defining it like we couldn't possibly know the meaning. She makes condescending remarks about older people receiving cancer treatments. Apparently, once you've reached a certain age, it's less meaningful to be ravaged by cancer? She acts like she comes from humble beginnings but then describes how her mom owns an apartment in NYC and her family owns a home in Saratoga and a cabin in Vermont. And she studied abroad. And she traveled to India while supposedly living on disability. Meh. I really struggled to finish this one. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

Her world soon revolves around appointments, treatments and hospital wards.. Her social life is with her treating team and co-patients as well as her boyfriend Will who finds himself in a carer role and her parents who are beside themselves with worry. Suleika endures a treatment that is not guaranteed to cure her and she is forced to face her own mortality. While coming to grips with all of this she is grieving for her fellow patients who succumb to their cancers. On the flip side having survived her treatment she finds the journey back to the kingdom of the well just as overwhelming and difficult to face. She is no longer the same person, and she goes on a journey to connect with the people who wrote to her and helped her when she was at her lowest.

It's a powerful story about believing in yourself and the power of dreaming big. Phil Knight traveled throughout Europe while trying to determine what to do with his life. He had run track and became interested in selling track shoes. He visited a shoe manufacturer in Japan and on the spot indicated he had a business in Oregon and wanted to buy shoes from them. Initially he named the company Blue Ribbon after the blue ribbons hanging in his childhood bedroom from competing in track meets. The book follows the ups and downs as a start up that experienced massive growth but was thrown out of two banks because their margins were thin and they were constantly cash strapped. There are fascinating litigation battles around trademarks, contracts, and custom fees. Runner Steve Prefontaine was one of the first athletes that Nike endorsed and he died at age twenty-four in a car accident. When they finally started paying attention to advertising, some of their earlier ads included the phrase, \"There is no finish line.\" Another ad indicated, \"Beating the competition is relatively easy. Beating yourself is a never-ending commitment.\" Highly recommend! This is a book about a business that reads like a corporate thriller. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

The premise and setting of the story is something I want to go visit - an island of unicorns, dragons, castles, and quests. Professor Addie Cox is our main protagonist. She is invited by a tech guru/CEO to join some military types to invade a fantasy island and figure out who is trying to revolt and take over the island. Addie has PTSD from her past experience with a shooting, which gives her character real depth and this comes into play throughout the novel. She is in love with the world, which I totally get, but her decisions throughout the novel astound me. Let's go follow this machine, let's sneak off even in dangerous situations, etc. Up until the end i just kept smacking my head at her choices. She showed up at the end though and I was thankful for it. The military trope team that goes with Addie are all fine characters, and I definitely understood their actions much better than Addie's. Addie's ex I wanted to punch, but I suppose that was intentional. The world building was fine, but throughout I wanted more...suspense? Danger? Throughout the novel it was all \"oooh\" and \"ahhh\" and the danger really didn't come into play until the very end. You wonder why everyone is so intense when really nothing goes on until the last 40 pages. Everything is mechanical/software/biotech and I went in hoping it really was like Jurassic Park in that things were REAL. So that was a little disappointing. The themes are cropped together from multiple existing fantasy stories, games, and movies so if you are a nerd you will get a million references. Which I think was the general point of this book overall. Don't let my critiques ward you off though, this was a fun little novel and I thought it worth a read (although maybe borrow it from your library). I would have loved to visit the fantasy island! And it does have some good action in there at the end and some back and forth about reality versus engineered fantasy. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

Don’t even think about stopping until you get there, and don’t give much thought to where “there” is. Whatever comes, just don’t stop.\" Motivation on spot. Enjoyed it. Once you start reading this one, pray you could stop in between. It was a real struggle for me. I just couldn't stop reading it. I feel like I should have read this book years ago. But I still feel great reading it now because I still have the desire to make some huge changes in my life. And no matter how hard people try to convince me anything different but I would always say it's books that actually make things work. And this book is actually one of them. This guy is someone I could totally relate with. At least he's had some people in his family and friend circle who supported him both financially and emotionally from the very beginning. But the real lesson lies in the fact that we see our dreams first and the first step starting with us. Now I believe traveling and experiencing new places do impact our minds and how we evolve too. Otherwise nothing much will change living the same life everyday until we die. I enjoyed meeting Bowerman through this book. An interesting personality I would say. And Johnson. This personality is something I would want to avoid but yes, something I want to keep a track on. The best part about the book is that it's hard to stop reading in between. Yes, that's right. For a non-fiction autobiography, it's awesome to read something that's been written this well which felt like I was reading a fast-paced novel worried about our clueless main character. No, he isn't exactly clueless but his life during the 1960s sounds clueless with the extreme personalities he had to deal with. It's business that was booming and crashing. It's now or never it seems. It's do or die it tells. The whole book got me anxious the entire time worried about the anxiety he and his partners had to deal with. But also, it gave me time to consider things that are inevitable to build a business. And not just business, but some things we need to reconsider when it comes to our lives and for people who want to change their lives. The business with the Japanese read like I was reading about some suspense much like the dilemma of the author. The risks are high yet what matters is we do not stop trying. And here, not just trying but learning things and going for the same goal using different plans that's might most possibly work out the best. It's about the connection, the right people we can trust, the investments we can do, consistently learning from our mistakes and knowing the people we are involved with and for those who we are giving the services for. Each person or character mentioned has something to tell the reader. I love their enthusiasm and positive vibes. I liked the parts where Woodell had things to say. Kitami surprised me. But then again, let's me know the idea of \"keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer\". There's this part of terrorist attack in which athletes were kidnapped. Told you, this book is just too interesting to put down once you start reading it. I loved how one setback after another setback for almost a decade to deal with how he kept telling himself to \"keep going\" and not to stop. I could see how persuasive and determined he was. Competition is cut throat. It's exciting to read about it. This book will let you see what goes in the making of a world conquering brand. All the hard work, the determination, the conflicts, the laws and rules, the difficulties and the oppositions, the connections and the teamwork. I mean it's not all the details and everything but you will get to see a good view of what made Nike as it is today. When you are good (believing in what you do no matter what!), never give up on making it better and take indefinite number of chances to make it big and there's nothing to stop you. Instead everyone would want to find you, know you through what you do. And yes, it tells us not to think too much about the jalebis. No, the jealous baes, I mean. Be focused.

The story begins \"Once there was a boy who lived in a cabin in the deep woods with no one for company but an old woman and an old man\" We learn the story of Dirk, whom the old woman and old man find in the woods as a young child, knowing not where he came from. The reclusive couple decide to raise the child until one day, years later, they decide they can no longer care for him. The old woodcutter takes him out into the deep forest, where things take a turn, for the better or worse, or perhaps neither or both. Thus truly begins Dirk's story, his remarkable yet unremarkable life. I mostly loved Hiddensee though occasionally it was slow-moving, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It is a terrific adult fairy tale, magical and whimsical, and a must-read for Maguire fans and lovers of story re-tellings. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: 2016 is the year of Donald Trump, and J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy should be at the top of every politico and thought leader's reading list living in the Acela corridor. Vance is both an excellent writer and a thoughtful person—and when combined with a compelling story, he's able to shed some light on the lives of those living on the other side of the Appalachian Mountains. Let's start with what this book isn't. It's not an explanation of why Donald Trump is the Republican nominee, or at least not directly. Nor is it a guide for how to alleviate Appalachian poverty. Vance is too smart to offer simplistic explanations or solutions. Rather, it is one man's experience living in the culture of Appalachia and placing his experience in the broader context of American society. It is the fact that he doesn't try to do too much that makes this book as compelling as it is. Vance grew up in southeastern Ohio and eastern Kentucky, largely raised by his grandmother (Mamaw) and having a complicated relationship with his family members. Hillbilly Elegy is a story that demonstrates the full measure of the brokenness that wracks Appalachia, but it is also a story that exemplifies the depths of familial love and opportunity. Vance's description of Yale Law School is interesting, because while he portrays it as an institution in which he feels out of place (very few people from poor backgrounds go to Yale Law School), he also was afforded the opportunity to go there. That tension—the fact that he managed to \"beat the odds\" while still acknowledging the deep cultural divide between elite institutions and wide swaths of middle America (the region of the United States sometimes derisively referred to as \"flyover country\")—pervades the book and ultimately makes it such an important book. For that tension exists not merely in the people like Vance who have a foot in both worlds—one in southeastern Ohio with his hillbilly family and the other in downtown San Francisco working for an investment fund. It also exists in the United States writ large, as college-educated urbanites express confusion at the values of those outside of their spheres. There are, therefore, two Americas—one divided less by race or geography (though those certainly matter), but by class and values. In order to break down those barriers, we need books like Hillbilly Elegy and people like Vance to help us build bridges across those cultural barriers we have today. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

This book was so emotional for me, I don’t even know why I was crying most of the time. I was crying because I was happy, then sad then heartbroken 💔. Tex fought so hard for his father. And when he didn’t win, I burst out crying, I was so hurt for Tex. My emotions were just all over the place. I realized that a person childhood can determine your adulthood. Tex childhood was a very sad and traumatic experience but he was still compassionate and humble. He still believed in the good old justice. He believed truth would prevail. He believed in his father’s innocence and he remained faithful to that belief. His father was a great man who taught Tex the importance of life values. Tex lived by those principles his father instilled into him. I felt it in my soul when Tex beg his dad to hang on for him. That scene and the sunset scene ripped my soul. Bravo for Michelle for finally doing something good and right. I just love the Hunter family. They are so close-knit after experiencing loss, tragic and turmoil early in their lives. I can’t imagine being subjected to the rejection and being an outcast because of society’s cruelty, but they overcame those monstrosities. I still think Tex needs some counseling. I wish there were more real life Tex in this world. I won’t speak on the relationship with Esther, I’m not fond on that.

            "⚠ Translation error: Really torn about this one. On the one hand, this is an amazingly honest account of Roxane Gay's life with an unruly body, as she calls it, which developed after she was gang raped at 12. She ate and ate so that she could get big enough to build a fortress around herself. On the other hand, the book fell short for me. It was repetitive, for one, although I do think some of the repetition was purposeful--a stylistic choice. The language, to me, was dull. Plus there was nothing new on the subject of obesity or the politics surrounding it. The tone was understated--some anger and sadness underlying her words--yet at the same time it felt strangely unemotional. I didn't feel attached. But I will cut her all the slack in the world. She is revealing who she is, the struggles she has had--who am I to criticize the way she tells her story? Racism, body shaming, and feminism are all touched upon, but the real story is about how the persistent PTSD led to loneliness, shame, hunger (of more than just food), and her weight problem. She expresses a sort of quiet anger about the way obese people are perceived and treated. Gay has had to learn to live with her large body, which is on display to the world. She has had to navigate physically through a land that can't accommodate her size in many ways. Chairs are too small, for example, and if the chair has arms, watch out—they can give her bruises. Her body size makes everything hard. Short walks are too long and painful, stares are too hurtful, conversations are strained. Her recounting of endless humiliations is heartbreaking. Learning about the indignities the author has had to endure made me examine how I think of my body and others’. As I said, most of what she said about obesity I already knew and almost all of the feelings that go with being overweight have been talked about before. However, her theme is groundbreaking in this way: Instead of talking about her food addiction, she talks about her body. It’s the first time I’ve heard the subject discussed solely from the point of view of body image. Seldom do people talk about their body. They talk about addiction and their difficulty in overcoming it. They talk about shame, self-control, self-loathing (which are all things that an unruly big body cause), but they don’t talk about how PTSD can change one’s body. In the past, I might have thought of PTSD as only affecting the head. Here we see how it blew away not only mind, but also her body. Eating allowed her to create a needed fortress while giving her comfort. I found her description of getting a tattoo fascinating. And she shed some new light on the subject of bulimia. Her descriptions of her humiliations were the most vivid and well-described. When she got into general non-fiction rhetoric, my interest waned. I wanted everything to be first person. Gang raped at 12. At 12! How do you survive that psychologically? The damage from the brutal attack will never disappear. She's in her 40s now, and she still thinks of her attackers, sometimes obsessing about the ringleader, who she thought was her friend. It is impossible to put myself in her shoes; what she endured is unimaginable. But one thing is sure--an experience like this will mess with your head in ways I can't begin to comprehend. Gay's story is a sad one, but she isn't throwing a pity party. She just wants to be understood, and she gets kudos for her bravery in revealing such personal information, for showing her underbelly. I'm thinking that writing this was probably therapeutic for her. How do you rate a memoir? Especially one where the author makes herself so vulnerable? I must remember that I'm not rating her life, just the way she tells her story. I admire Gay’s brilliance, bravery, and life, and I will continue to get my hands on everything she writes. I wanted to love this one, I really did, especially since Gay's novel An Untamed State is one of my all-time favorites. No dull language in that one. It still haunts me. The novel was based on her experience of gang rape. I felt it was a way more powerful book than this memoir, but I'm not at all sorry I read this book. I liked it, just didn't love it. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: People see bodies like mine and make their assumptions. They think they know the why of my body. They do not. This is not a story of triumph, but this is a story that demands to be told and deserves to be heard. How do I even begin? If I could give this book a hundred stars, I would. And no, not just because it is important and it is heartbreaking - which it is both - but because Gay is one of the best writers I've ever known . The difficulty was deciding how to use quotes without quoting the whole damn book. I was glued to the pages, completely rapt, as the author used words to create a plethora of emotions and reveal things about the world we live in. This is Gay's memoir from the time she was gang raped at twelve-years-old, to her later need to use food to build a fortress around herself, to her more recent life as a woman categorized as the horrendous phrase \"super morbidly obese\". Mine is not a success story. Mine is, simply, a true story. It is not a memoir that asks for our pity, or tries to manipulate the reader, it is simply a woman's truth. Gay's self-awareness is painful to read as she talks about experiences in narrow seating on airlines, in movie theatres or restaurants, or at events. The assumptions people make about her; the \"concerns\" for her health; the ultimate belief that as a woman, a fat woman, she just takes up too much space. You can tell on the rare occasions when an author really lays themselves bare. Gay says the things that many are - for a whole variety of reasons - afraid to say. About rape culture, about fat people, about fat women, and about the fat acceptance movement. She says she prefers \"victim\" to \"survivor\" because she has been hurt and has suffered from what happened to her, and she doesn't want to turn into something more empowering than it actually is. I do not want pity or appreciation or advice. I am not brave or heroic. I am not strong. I am not special. I am one woman who has experienced something countless women have experienced. I am a victim who survived. *** He said/she said is why so many victims (or survivors, if you prefer that terminology) don’t come forward. All too often, what “he said” matters more, so we just swallow the truth. We swallow it, and more often than not, that truth turns rancid. It spreads through the body like an infection. It becomes depression or addiction or obsession or some other physical manifestation of the silence of what she would have said, needed to say, couldn’t say. When she talks about the FAM, she considers what many fat-positive women and men are not supposed to say - that it is not a simple matter of deciding that one's fatness is okay and attractive. We do not live in a world that allows for that mentality to take hold instantly, no matter how much we tell ourselves that weight and size do not matter. To be clear, the fat acceptance movement is important, affirming, and profoundly necessary, but I also believe that part of fat acceptance is accepting that some of us struggle with body image and haven’t reached a place of peace and unconditional self-acceptance. It is an incredibly powerful memoir that is made even more so by the raw, uncensored truth Gay brings to it. Gay is not happy with her body, but also angry at the world for being a place that makes her unhappy with her body. She says she is not strong and that she is not brave, but I beg to differ. Writing a book like this in a world like this-- I'd say she's one of the strongest, bravest writers I know.

Renee had a crush on Kane since she was a little girl, even though he was her godfather and her dad's BFF. However, nothing ever happened between them until her senior year in high school (when she was already 18) and she found his private journal in which she discovered his fantasies about the two of them being together. She decided to take the journal and use it to force him to fulfill both of their fantasies. Things went well for several months, but then after graduation, and during the party afterward that her dad threw for her, Kane broke things off when she told him she didn't want to be \"a dirty little secret\" and wanted to go public with their relationship. Then he left. Neither of them were happy in the time that followed. Although Renee had learned she was pregnant shortly before graduation, she hadn't told Kane about the baby. She decided not to burden him with an unwanted child. However, Kane took matters into his own hands and showed up at her dad's house, only for them to be caught by her dad in the middle of a spicy moment. This was a really enjoyable story, with plenty of angst, drama, and spice. It had a lot of twists and turns that kept it interesting. The plot was simple, yet the story flowed freely and smoothly. While the MMC was mature and well-developed, the FMC was more than a little immature and underdeveloped. She had a lot of growing up to do, but she managed to do that in the time after the breakup and reunion.

She shouldn’t want him like this, but the taboo of it makes her want him even more. One day, Renee stumbles upon her godfather’s journal with erotic entries about her. Oh my! Undoubtedly, she takes the book. To alleviate her sexual appetite, she tries to have sex with her loser boyfriend, which ends up being so awkward and unsatisfying. He couldn’t even get it in right. Too funny! She needed a REAL MAN to please her, not some inexperienced high school boy. Renee may be willing to give back the journal if he would give her something in return. How will her father react if she ever revealed the dirty thoughts his best friend had been having for his daughter? Blackmail, baby! Their first time was with her dad sleeping 2 feet away in the same room. Wow! Were the 2 playing with fire, especially with all the handsy gestures and flirty looks? I liked how Kane helps Renee with her college dilemma. It’s true: most college graduates don’t get a job in the field they studied. College isn’t for everyone. Kane inspired her to pursue her heart, which was sweet and hot. The sex arrangement was great, but questions soon arise. Was Kane really into her or just giving in to her blackmail? What will happen if her dad finds out? Can they go back to the way they were? So much love and drama boils down to an explosive ending.

But it’s still the case that our current set of political problems is a very frightening one, and the level of fear and uncertainty about the future is much more extreme than usual, especially as—thanks to rising fascism and climate change—we face the shivering breakdown of the real. It’s easy to suggest that if people just consumed better and more accurate narratives about reality, they’d be more equipped to handle it. But it’s less easy to determine what those healthy fictional narratives are, and what problems we can realistically expect them to solve for us. So this was one of my most anticipated reads of the year, so much so that I ordered it for my school library. It was surprisingly a bit different than I expected, especially when it got quite philosophical, which I really appreciated. The main argument, art for art's sake is one that has been beaten for centuries but I hadn't seen it explained with this perspective before, which gave me a lot of much needed insight on the topic (I mean, seriously that chapter with the CIA...wtf). However, sadly, no scratch that, very upsettingly while the ideas presented were immaculate (and extremely important in this contemporary political era), I really hated it structurally. What actually makes it such a bummer is that this book is extremely unique in the subject matter, since, even as a literature student I never see fiction that we experience in our day to day lives given much merit, so it's vital we talk about these things but genuinely parsing throught these essays was a chore and it didn't need to be. I felt like Gold jumped from topic to topic without much regard for transitions, and it left everything up in the air. Or more like chewing up 5 different types of bubblegum at once (does that count as a food metaphor?). Right when she said something important, something worth mulling over a bit, she would switch to another topic. Instead of essays, it felt more like reading a commulation of paragraphs with only mere traces of each other to connect them, and only if you squint a bit. It's just really difficult, when reading, to meld all these ideas together in a way in which they all posit their meaning to the fullest. Although I can look past this in fiction, with nonfiction I think this is the most important bit, not the ideas presented or how much the reader agrees with them but instead how well the author can put them through to the reader. Again, since my biggest gripe is technical, I would still recommend checking it out, even if only for Chapter 4 and Chapter 8, which I think were the most successful in being succinct. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: “When I talk about free indirect style I am really talking about point of view, and when I talk about point of view I am really talking about the perception of detail, and when I talk about detail I'm really talking about character, and when I talk about character I am really talking about the real, which is at the bottom of my inquiries.” ― James Wood, How Fiction Works You might not agree with everything James Wood has to say about a particular author or work of literature, but you have to admit there isn’t another booklover more passionately dedicated to careful reading, finely honed criticism and upholding high standards. How Fiction Works is case in point: very much like an expert mechanic examining the assorted parts of the engine in an Italian or German sports car, James Wood rolls up his sleeves and scrutinizes various aspects of what goes into the writing of fiction, especially the novel. His particular method is to undergird his analysis and reasoning with numerous examples – this is a fairly short book but there are over 100 individual literary novels quoted or referenced, from Don Quixote, Jane Eyre, Madame Bovary, What Maisie Knew, Sister Carrie and Ulysses to Invisible Man, Lolita, Seize the Day, Blood Meridian, Atonement and Gilead . And this is not exactly an easy book to read; I myself had to break an intellectual sweat, rereading passages again and again to grasp more completely Mr. Wood’s thinking. To share some of the many insights a reader will find in its pages, below are specific James Wood quotes coupled with my comments: “In reality, we are stuck with third- and first-person narration. The common idea is that there is a contrast between reliable narration (third-person omniscient) and unreliable narrator (the unreliable first-person narrator, who knows less about himself than the reader eventually does). On one side Tolstoy, say; and on the other, Humbert Humbert or Italo Sveno’s narrator, Zeno Cosini, or Bertie Wooster.” The author spends a good number of his opening pages explaining the dynamics of voice, that is, the manner in which a story is told. At one point he notes: “Actually, the first-person narration is generally more reliable than unreliable; and third-person “omniscient” narration is generally more partial than omniscient.” I’m reminded of a personal favorite, the way Colin Harrison opens his Bodies Electric using a first-person narrator who is both completely reliable and painfully honest: “My name is Jack Whitman and I should never have had the first thing to do with her. I shouldn’t have indulged myself – my loneliness, my attraction to her – not with what was happening at the Corporation at the time. But I’m as weak hearted for love and as greedy for power as the next guy, maybe more so. And I was crazy for the sex – of course that was part of it.” These opening four sentences, set off like a string of explosions, give us a clear indication of what fireworks we can expect as we turn the pages. “It is useful to watch good writers make mistakes. Plenty of excellent ones stumble at free indirect style.” Free indirect style being a blending of objective third-person narration with the thoughts and words of a character. James Wood shares the example of how John Updike in his novel Terrorist , in order to propel the story, puts impossible thoughts in the head of his eighteen-year old main character, impossible in the sense that an eighteen-year old could never have such thoughts and could never express such thoughts in the novelist’s sophisticated language. Major blunder! By the way, years ago when Updike’s novel S was first published, I recall reviewers claiming that the main character in the novel, a young woman by the name of Sarah Worth, wrote letters as if she had the literary talent of a John Updike. Again, major blunder! “Novelists should thank Flaubert the way poets thank spring: it all begins again with him. There really is a time before Flaubert and a time after him. Flaubert decisively established what most readers and writers think of as modern realist narration, and his influence is almost too familiar to be visible.” In order to fully dissect how fiction works and why fiction works, Mr. Wood delves into the history of the novel, particularly innovations made within the nineteenth century. James Wood details why no novelist ever had a more profound influence on the novel than Gustave Flaubert. “Literature makes us better noticers of life; we get to practice on life it --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: I previously read The Nearest Thing to Life , a collection of several lectures on literature, from 2013, by British-American literary expert James Wood (° 1965). The book under review (How Fiction Works) is both older and newer: it was originally published in 2007, but was updated in a second edition to 2018. Here Wood explains, somewhat more systematically than in the first book, how literature actually works. Of course, this concerns technical aspects of writing (the narrator's point of view, the difference between plot and form, the use of indirect style and authorial irony, etc.), but a great many more substantive aspects are also discussed. In particular the question whether fiction is realistic is central: at first glance this seems like a 'contradictio in terminis', but Wood perfectly illustrates how authors can approach reality very closely through fiction. He cleverly sidesteps the ‘question of truth’ by emphasizing liveliness: “Realism, seen broadly as truthfulness to the way things are, cannot be mere verisimilitude, cannot be mere lifelikeness, or lifesameness, but what I must call lifeness: life on the page, life brought to different life by the highest artistry.” Again, Wood appeals to ‘imagination’ as the ultimate technique of good literature: not life as it is, but as we can imagine it. And just as in his previous book, that is actually a religious finality: “So fiction – here I’m extrapolating from Walter Benjamin – ideally offers us a power we tend to lack in our own lives: to reflect on the form and direction of our existence; to see the birth, development and end of a completed life. The novel provides us with the religious power to see beginnings and endings.” As mentioned, this edition has been updated to include (next to classics like Tolstoy and Flaubert) authors such as Karl-Ove Knausgard, Elena Ferrante and Teju Cole. Wood really helps you to pay attention to the details, and thus to appreciate literature (even more). --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: I thought this book would be written more with a writerly-slant, but no. More with a readerly-slant, turns out. Still, as a writer wading into novel-writing, you can pick up a thing or two. Up to you, I imagine Wood thinking. He's more about educating readers. The good thing? This is mostly approached in layman's terms. It does not come across as high-falutin', ivory tower, show-off talk (that is, when authors have an audience of fellow professors in mind). The other good thing? Wood uses so many excerpts by way of example, you will find yourself wanting to read some of the books he alludes to. For me that would be books like The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis (Saramago), Sabbath's Theater (Roth), Seize the Day (Bellow), The Waves (Woolf), The Rainbow (Lawrence), and Wittgenstein's Nephew (Bernhard) to name a few. It's always embarrassing to see how not-so-well-read you are when you read books about reading, isn't it? Anyway, the sections of the book give you an idea about where James Wood goes with this: \"Narrating,\" \"Flaubert and Modern Narrative,\" \"Flaubert and the Rise of the Flaneur,\" \"Detail,\" \"Character,\" \"A Brief History of Consciousness,\" \"Sympathy and Complexity,\" \"Language,\" \"Dialogue,\" and \"Truth, Convention, Realism.\" The \"Realism\" discussion at the end is amusing. Nobody quite agrees on what is real, and many newer writers like to pile on and dis \"realism\" in very realistic ways. Whatever. I leave that to the philosophers, who also disagree on what a chair is. This is, in the end, a book you'll enjoy if you like reading about reading.

A human like everyone else who chose to follow her passion for music and connect with different souls. \"𝙔𝙤𝙪’𝙡𝙡 𝙣𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙧 𝙬𝙖𝙡𝙠 𝙞𝙣 𝙢𝙮 𝙨𝙝𝙤𝙚𝙨, 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙄’𝙡𝙡 𝙣𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙧 𝙬𝙖𝙡𝙠 𝙞𝙣 𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙧𝙨. 𝘼𝙣𝙙 𝙬𝙚 𝙨𝙝𝙤𝙪𝙡𝙙𝙣’𝙩 𝙝𝙖𝙫𝙚 𝙩𝙤 𝙞𝙣 𝙤𝙧𝙙𝙚𝙧 𝙩𝙤 𝙚𝙢𝙥𝙖𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙯𝙚 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝 𝙚𝙖𝙘𝙝 𝙤𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙧.\" A lot of people fail to understand that even though singers are famous for their songs or actors are famous for their skills does not change them from one of us. They are still humans, they still get hurt, they still cry, and they still struggle. Just because fame was won by their talents didn't make them immune to human feelings. So why do people treat them in a way they would never treat a normal office job person? Madison Beer brought light into the simple fact that we all are humans and sometimes people are so blinded that they don't realize it. \"𝙏𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙨 𝙡𝙞𝙠𝙚 𝙡𝙤𝙨𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙥𝙧𝙞𝙫𝙖𝙘𝙮, 𝙤𝙧 𝙗𝙚𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙘𝙤𝙣𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙣𝙩𝙡𝙮 𝙪𝙥 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝙘𝙧𝙞𝙩𝙞𝙘𝙞𝙨𝙢—𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙣 𝙤𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙨 𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙙𝙤𝙣’𝙩 𝙥𝙚𝙧𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙣 𝙩𝙤 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙟𝙤𝙗—𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝙟𝙪𝙨𝙩 𝙙𝙚𝙚𝙢𝙚𝙙 '𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩 𝙤𝙛 𝙞𝙩.' \" If you were the one walking on the street for a cup of coffee and were suddenly invited by the flashy cameras, how would you feel? Scared? Uncomfortable? So how is it different from singers? If you become famous overnight these feelings won't disappear with it. Normalizing losing privacy and online hate just because you're famous sounds ridiculous. Of course, people are curious about the most talked about celebrity but there’s a clear limit. Recording a person is called stalking and has serious consequences however recording a celebrity is ok? What's the difference? Aren't celebrities people too? \"𝘽𝙧𝙤𝙠𝙚𝙣 𝙗𝙤𝙣𝙚𝙨 𝙝𝙚𝙖𝙡; 𝙬𝙤𝙧𝙙𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙨𝙩𝙞𝙘𝙠 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝙖 𝙡𝙞𝙛𝙚𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙚.\" People often overlook the hurt caused by one word, one sentence, and one comment. It's crazy how miserable a sentence by someone who hastily wrote it, meant it as a joke, etc. We often overlook how words that we probably let slip might have stayed with them for a whole day, a whole week, or even more than that. A simple joke such as shaming someone for their body can end up making them go into eating disorders, a simple joke about posting private videos or pictures can cause the person to take drastic measures. Now imagine thousands and millions of people attacking one innocent soul on social media just because they are famous. They’re still human, they still get affected and it's still cyberbullying or even worse than that. This book hit me on deep levels as I've always dreamt of being a singer until last year. I'm the type of person who fears getting hurt because of past experiences. Now everyone fears getting hurt but I fear in a way that when I walk down the stairs I walk slowly and look at every step to make sure I don't fall. I may sound weak but I'm fragile like that, That is how I was shaped due to the sharp edges of words. I gave up on this dream for several reasons one of them being the ugly truth of fame and I pray for everyone who's going through a hard time. This memoir raises various topics like this and gives a detailed talk about them. It also shines on Madison’s music journey and her journey of taking control of her own life. It's a motivating book where you can see the journey of heart-shattering struggles that blossom Madison Beer into a healthier and happier version of herself. I love how the book was formatted with all the prompts, journals, and fan questions and I'm pretty sure I annotated so much of the book. “𝗦𝗶𝗿𝗶 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝗹𝗯𝘂𝗺 𝗟𝗶𝗳𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁” 𖦹 ▶︎ •၊၊||၊|။||||။‌‌‌‌‌၊|• 𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗳𝗶𝘀𝗵 𝟯:𝟰𝟯 𝗤𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗲𝘀 \"𝙈𝙮 𝙖𝙗𝙞𝙡𝙞𝙩𝙮 𝙩𝙤 𝙗𝙚 𝙫𝙪𝙡𝙣𝙚𝙧𝙖𝙗𝙡𝙚 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝 𝙢𝙮𝙨𝙚𝙡𝙛 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙤𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙧𝙨 𝙞𝙨 𝙨𝙩𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙜𝙩𝙝, 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙣𝙤𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙡𝙚𝙨𝙨.\" “𝙇𝙞𝙛𝙚 𝙞𝙨𝙣’𝙩 𝙖 𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙚𝙩𝙞𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣.

            "⚠ Translation error: Sometimes I adored the writing, and sometimes I didn’t fancy the lyricism. Sometimes I had all the emotions, and sometimes I didn’t feel a thing. Sometimes I wanted to rate this five gorgeous stars, and sometimes my rating was spiraling down. How can I be so conflicted about a book? Mack has mixed feelings too. Being in love with K., wanting to be with him, but always kept at a distance. Then meeting Fin, so vibrant and alive, a boy who immediately catches his eyes. One boy still in the closet, the other one so out and proud. I adore stories written in verse. Besides, I love messy characters and relationships. And I had high hopes for Only on the Weekends because I treasured The Black Flamingo. Only on the Weekend has so much to love. The supporting cast, the messiness, Karim, Fin, and Mack’s relationship with his dad. But somehow, I also felt let down. Writing reviews usually comes easy to me but for this story? I just can’t find the words to express my feelings. I’m not even sure how I feel. Like I feel stuck in between? So, do I rate Only on the Weekends three stars because of my confusion and because I didn’t like everything? Or do I rate it four stars because I loved parts so much, was in awe of the poems, and cherished the ending? I’ve been in doubt for over a month and finally made a decision. I’m going to rate this story four stars. If you like books written in verse and love messy characters and relationships, please check out this book! This could be a real gem for you!

Love that for him. You go Mack Coco, all that.... However, it was still frustrating to read. It felt like I was getting half a story. They say not to judge a book by its cover, but this one? The insides match the raggedy outside. Forever bitter these two black boys look like an early 00s dress up simulator while Fin looking just fine. Don't get me started on how the UK is out here hoodwinking people into think they gonna get two black boys falling in love when what you get is this mess. There were so many topics that could have been explored if Atta didn't want to just keep pressing the enter key. There was no flow to the writing, the best moments were the various text messages. I am embarrassed to have read this book. I cannot think of a single person whose life would be enriched by experiencing the journey that I went on with this reading experience. I am eagerly looking forward to returning this book to the library. To the people that did enjoy this or did see themselves reflected, I love that for you. Truly. I wish I could have the experience that you did in place of the one I had. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: Dean Atta's Black Flamingo was one of the most creative and inspired stories I read last year, and in a similar vein, Only on the Weekends is a coming of age tale written entirely in verse. This YA story follows 15 yr old Mack who has always had a crush on Karim and when they finally become boyfriends, he feels like he's found the one. That is until his dad moves him from London to Scotland and Mack finds out just how painful love can be. Dean Atta has such a lyrical way with words, which helps to get the poignant themes, such as feelings of insecurity, first loves and many more, across in such an eloquent way. I didn't find this to be as impactful as the Black Flamingo, hence the lower rating, but still such a good book for the YA age range.

I did feel that the book ended kind of abruptly, but that could just be because I wanted to know more of the fallout from Mack’s decisions. Overall, the book was good. It had some points that were very cute and moved the story along. It had enjoyable characters and an easy to follow premise. Thank you NetGalley and Harpercollins for this eARC.

ONLY ON THE WEEKENDS follows Mack, a rich Black teen in London who lives with his Dad who is a famous film director. When Mack is paired up with Maz during food tech class they become fast friends which leads to him being introduced to his crush, her cousin Karim (K), the schools most popular basketball star. However, Mack’s love life get more complicated when his Dad moves them to Scotland where he meets trans teen icon, Finlay. I love a good complex character and Mack is definitely messy, at times frustratingly so. He is longing to love and be loved in return and in the process of finding it, he is selfish and takes the people around him for granted. But it’s so good to read a story that is realistic with characters that are familiar and true to life. I wish Mack explored in more detail K’s background, culture and his reasons for not wanting to come out. I would love a follow up story with K, Maz and Uncle O. The friendships with Femi, Cleo and Fin were at times equally hard to read and heart-warming, it spoke to the struggles many teens face. I particularly appreciated the dynamic with Mack and his Dad and how it evolved. The writing and poetry woven into the story was so naturally done, it was a pleasure to read even as it dealt with issues of racism, homophobia, toxic masculinity, anxiety, body confidence, grief, forgiveness and the freedom of being yourself.

            "⚠ Translation error: A very very, disappointing 2 stars I am so so so sad that I just didn't enjoy this. There are so many elements that I feel I really enjoyed, but then there was something in this that I just absolutely detested and because it was such a main part of the book it just kind of ruined everything for me. Saying that there are quite a few things that I enjoyed that I really do want to highlight because I think this rating reflects my personal preference of something (without going into spoilers). - K. I have to say I really did enjoy learning about K. We see that he's not super comfortable with his sexuality but he really does try to do thinks to make Mack feel loved and that he does want to be with him. I feel like so many people would be able to relate to K and I think he was wrote in such a way that many people will be able to see themselves in them. - Friendship dynamics, I liked that they could air their shit and be like nah you've made me feel this way and that whoever was friends with who they had this fiercely loyal protection between them. - Okay I didn't like Mack as a person because of what he did BUT I did like that he was authentically himself, and became more open with how he wanted to express himself. - Macks father and Gem. I know he wasn't always there but he just emanated to much pride when it came to Mack and he truly loved him. Okay I just need to get this off my chest without going too spoilery, the reason that this is rated so low is because I really, really disliked Mack as a character. I HATED what he was doing, it felt so selfish in some parts but then he'd be so giving in others and my head just can't wrap around things like this. I genuinely feel like if the big thing happened but not the way it did I don't think I'd have this much of an ick, but I can't deal with how things came to an end and I low key felt bad for certain characters and Mack was just so blasé about it. I wanted to rip my hair out and scream. Honestly just thinking about it is pissing me off all over again. On that note I'm finishing my partial rant review. Really disappointed that I didn't like this as much as what I thought I would have but I guess that's just how it played out. I will definitely still continue to read Dean Atta because I thoroughly enjoy their writing style, just sadly for me the themes in this just didn't work out well for me. --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: 3.5 As an experience worth basing a memoir around, Cho’s sudden, violent descent into postpartum psychosis a few months after the birth of her son is unparalleled. We meet Cho on a general psych ward in America. She’s supposed to be on holiday, travelling around the US with her husband and three month old to introduce him to family. But family pressure, sleep deprivation or plain old hormones rush in, and she starts hallucinating that the baby is the devil, the hospital is Hell, and she is a kind of latter-day Beatrice, charged with leading her husband safely out. This is the story of her journey back from the brink and of her restlessness to know what has caused the psychosis: was it genetics? Circumstance? Was it because she ignored the Korean traditions her parents and in-laws insist upon, and did not eat her seaweed soup, and left the house too soon after birth? Cho makes a good narrator for such a story, her very mildness and normalcy underlining the shocking violence of her experience. She is not at all the kind of person you would expect to find restrained on a gurney. And she weaves a number of interesting strands into her story, from Korean and Western mythology, to Dante, to musings into how family predisposes you for life, how Koreans feel the wounds of the North-South separation down the generations, how abusive relationships can shape a psyche. Structurally, I felt there were some problems. The most interesting aspect of the book is the psychotic breakdown itself, which is mostly told late in the story. The least interesting parts, surprisingly, are in the psych ward, where largely irrelevant characters bog down the story and where nothing much happens or develops. As with many memoirs, I suspected a long essay could have covered much of the same ground. Still, Cho writes well. Her prose is not “luminous and spiralling” as a nonsensical cover blurb suggests, but it is pleasingly straightforward and not too prone to poetic mumbo-jumbo. And it’s a fascinating story. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: In December one of my goodreads groups reads a celebrity memoir of choice in lieu of a group read. It’s a busy time and we don’t want members to be encumbered by reading. All the best laid plans, but my library is notoriously slow at processing new books. Thus January has started with a pile of new celebrity memoirs that I am just receiving now. I had been excited to read all of them so no big deal- books will get read when they get read. Growing up my main television was live sports and still is. Even though there were almost no women reporters or announcers at the time, my dream job was announcing for a specific baseball team. That never materialized but I still dream it from time to time. On the few times I forayed to watching the national news, mainly at my grandparents’, I didn’t notice many women anchors or reporters there either. This was the late 1980s thru early 1990s. I didn’t notice women in positions of prominence on television because sadly there were not that many of them besides the fictional Murphy Brown. One of the trailblazers was Connie Chung. She enjoyed stints at all three of the major news networks over the course of a groundbreaking career. Even though I did not know much about her career, I knew that this memoir could not wait for women’s history month. Connie Chung is the youngest child in her family. Her parents at a great personal cost to themselves immigrated to the United States at the end of World War II. They already had four daughters and attempted to assimilate into a society that did not have many Asians outside of California. One year later their youngest daughter was born and automatically became an American citizen. Her older sisters chose her name from the pages of People Magazine, and Connie Chung became the first truly American member of her family. Her father asked her to carry on the family’s name and how little did he know that his youngest daughter would become not just the most prominent member of their family, but of a generation of Asian women looking to achieve the American dream. Connie details her childhood and difficulties faced as a lower middle class immigrant family. Her mother was determined for her children to maintain their Chinese culture and sewed the family’s clothes and cooked their delicacies. She came from a well to do Chinese family and yet adapted to life as a 1950s housewife. She expected her older three daughters to marry Chinese men and they did. Connie lived an American childhood, graduating from an integrated high school and attending the University of Maryland. Unlike her sisters, Connie did not achieve an Mrs degree. Hers was the Betty Friedan generation that started to choose a career over starting a family at a young age. Upon graduation from Maryland, Connie went to work for the CBS affiliate in Washington, DC. As a cub reporter in an old boys network, she did not always earn top assignments. Usually she had to defer to seasoned reporters, all men. The dutiful employee, she was happy to be employed by a news agency and didn’t think much about her assignments. As a woman, she covered fashion shows, First Ladies, and Julie Nixon’s wedding. Male reporters would not be asked to take fluffy assignments as these but that is how the old boys viewed women intruders. A picture from Nixon’s Oval Office attests to this. Chung’s career arc took her to Los Angeles as a news anchor and then back to New York. Her closest friends in the industry were women trailblazers like herself but she was the only Asian. Her career included a one sided rivalry with Dan Rather and getting involved in a spat between Barbara Walters and Diane Sawyer. All Connie wanted to be was a top reporter. She enjoyed stories that made a difference like the silicone implants expose and an exclusive with the captain of the Exxon Valdez. Many remember her for her spat with Newt Gingrich’s mother but this is uneven remembrances perpetuated by the old boys’ network who did not want her “taking their stories.” This career arc came at the expense of raising a traditional family, and she finally adopted her son Matthew when she neared fifty, an age when women are usually shafted aside for younger, “prettier” looking women. Her biggest supporter at this time has been her husband of forty years Maury Povich, who I gained more respect for after reading this account, especially after he referred to Connie as the Jackie Robinson of Asian women on television. That brought a huge smile to my face. Al --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",
            "⚠ Translation error: I Like Her I didn’t know much about Connie Chung, but there was something about her that appealed to me. I always thought that she was so bright and so pretty. I was interested in learning more about her. Immediately, I was drawn to her candor. She didn’t hold back on how she felt about people. She was a little sassy and a lot spunky. I loved that. She came off as so poised and unbreakable. I really enjoyed learning about her courtship with Maury. Her family’s background was also very interesting. I wasn’t as invested in some of her political recollections, but I loved hearing about her career path. She spilled some good tea about some big name folks.

            "⚠ Translation error: Maybe it's just my reporter training, but as I was reading, I kept thinking how her descriptions of India sounded almost too familiar, as if they had been lifted from other sources—movies she had seen, books she had read, stories she'd absorbed, scenes she had imagined. Germany struck me as much the same. But I just read along, increasingly appalled but not giving the truthfulness of the narrative too much thought. That is, until they arrived in Israel, where I live. That's where this supposed memoir started to unravel for me. I strongly doubt that the Israel episode ever happened. First red flag: No one ever arrived in Tel Aviv in the summer and remarked upon the dry desert heat. They would say, \"Wow, is it ever humid here!\" Then the whole scenario of having fake Brazilian passports with a Brazilian name that MIGHT sound Jewish, and no one knowing a word of Portuguese other than the mother, the paterfamilias looking like he just emerged from the backwoods of North America, and all of this getting past Israeli security? Didn't happen. Because if I can swing a \"gato\" in Israel and hit someone who speaks Brazilian Portuguese and who could quickly demolish an absurd backstory on a moment's notice—trust me, so can Israeli security. Not to mention getting anything past the rabbis, who are even less inclined to believe unsubstantiated claims of being born and raised Jewish. The anti-Semitic trope of her father believing that the Jews run the finances of the world was awful enough, especially when you consider that the author brings to bear all sorts of adult observations to her childhood, but, unsettling enough, not this one. Which brings me to another anti-Semitic trope and the biggest red flag of all. I can tell you for a fact that no Israeli ever looked at a blonde, blue-eyed child and told her she \"doesn't look Jewish.\" Israelis don't even think in those terms. I've heard this idiocy repeated countless times in the States by uninformed non-Jews, but never once in Israel, where I raised two children, one of whom was blond with green eyes. It just doesn't happen in a country where Jews ingathered from all over the world -- Ethiopia, Russia, Yemen, Germany, Egypt, Poland, Brazil, India, Morocco, Scotland and Iraq, to name just a few -- and their coloring, and that of their intermarrying descendants, ranges just as widely. Placing the family smack in the center of the bridge tragedy at the 1997 Maccabiah Games seemed a little too convenient, too, especially when the information she recites reads as if she'd lifted it from the Wikipedia entry. Smaller red flags: Her claim that the age of Bat Mitzvah is 13, when even a pretend Jewish kid who went to a Jewish school would know it's 12. Then the brother goes off to study at a yeshiva in New York? It all beggars belief. I'm halfway through the book, and I'll continue, just to see what happens. I should give this one-star, based on the fabrications, but that would mean it's unreadable, which it isn't. Instead, I'm approaching it as a highly embroidered memoir and awarding that extra star for imagination. After all, she said herself that one of the skills she learned growing up was to lie. And that I believe 100 percent. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

            "⚠ Translation error: The best fiction writing text I've ever read. LaPlante gives equal treatment to craft (method) and heart (madness), and encourages young writers to learn the rules so that they can be broken. Unlike other craft texts, the tone is lively, sassy, and playful, rather than dry, dull, and condescending. Two of my favorite lines from the book are: \"The only rule for fiction is that it be interesting.\" \"Creative writing is the one area where you don't want to be 'appropriate.' Appropriate is for dinner parties.\" Yes. Finally, because LaPlante approaches common topics from such fresh angles, instructors also benefit a great deal from this book; I'm a better teacher for having read this book (something that can't be said for a lot of craft texts that don't offer anything we haven't already read or heard a billion times). --> No translation was found using the current translator.

            "⚠ Translation error: The one book I recommend to people [about writing] more than anything. Covering both fiction and narrative nonfiction, the book deals with a topic per chapter, from plot to dialogue to character. Just like every other writing book. But this book does a couple of things better than any other book I’ve seen: it has a less stringent focus on exercises, and it includes full texts. I don’t like writing books that want to kick me out and send me off to do something and come back to it later. I want a book to let me consume it, sit with it for a while, and then do exercises if I want to. Frankly, I’m kind of down on exercises as it is, since I don’t like being told what to write when it comes to fiction. Also, a big problem with writing books is the way they tell you how writer X does something right, then presents a passage from the story in question, pulled out of context from the rest of the story. Which does the job, but wouldn’t it be better to have the full story in front of you? If you’re telling me what an amazing job Flannery O’Connor does characterizing the Grandmother in ‘A Good Man is Hard to Find’, is it better to give me a snapshot, or the whole story? I understand this is likely a copyright issue, excerpts under a certain length being exempt from royalty payments. But TMOAS opens the purse, and pays for the reprint rights. So if LaPlante is discussing how Cheever sprinkles details throughout ‘The Swimmer’, you’ll be able to see for yourself and read the story at the end of the chapter, with a trio of review questions to help you crystallize in your mind what the story excels at. Simply the best book you can get on the technical aspects. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",

Everyone battles with something, everyone has inner demons they need to fight. He shows us with these carefully crafted characters that people are not perfect and we shouldn't ask them to be, we should ask them to be who they are. Real. Charlie and Gloria are two characters that I wish were my friends. Charlie with his eccentric ways, how he can't seem to talk fast enough because he has too many words to say, and his love for his telescope and everything the universe holds. Gloria who was well, glorious. Broken and strong and artistic. I loved watching them both develop over the course of the book, how they come to realise that not tackling pain head on will only come back to bite you in the ass. And the secondary characters were just as awesome, in a more unassuming way. Edison with his crazy insane wheelchair and that old wise head of his.

The ending was happy, but I couldn't help but feel sad because of the gloomy tone it was written in. Before reading, I had also thought the book would be about a growing friendship and becoming happy with your true self. This was not the case. It was about the two main characters becoming basically obsessed with each other, which was kind of a letdown.

            "⚠ Translation error: ‘I’m a writer who incidentally also makes films—films are my voyage, and writing is home. And—40 years, I keep preaching to deaf ears that my writing will arguably outlive my films, all of them.’ — Werner Herzog I don’t even like Herzog (as in I don’t know much about him or his work, but loved his thoughts on Baker’s ‘The Peregrine’, which then got me to read this), but this is brilliant. The audiobook is also fucking fantastic – read by the author himself, of course. If a piece of work gets me swearing affectionately, I must consciously/subconsciously regard it with a substantial amount of raw admiration/affection. To clarify, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience even though (needless to say) I don’t necessarily agree with all of Herzog’s views. Perhaps sometimes I find him even more interesting and endearing when our views on certain matters clash (mostly because he's got such a meticulous and brilliant way of expressing his thoughts, one can’t help but surrender one’s full attention). He’s a strange one; and that’s a top-tier compliment (coming from me anyway). Too many fab chunks to choose from, but here’s a whole lot of them anyway : ‘‘He never read the books he was supposed to read; he never studied. It seemed he never knew the things he was meant to know. But then, in fact, Werner always knew everything. His senses were extraordinary. He could pick out some note or sound and ten years later remember it exactly. He would talk about it and use it in some way. He’s completely incapable of explaining anything. He knows, he sees, he understands, but he can’t explain. That’s not in his nature. With him, everything goes in. And if it comes out again, then it will be in some altered form.’ It’s not an easy matter, quoting one’s own mother, and I don’t think she’s always right. I do think I’ve learned to explain a thing or two, maybe. But I have a deep aversion to too much introspection, to navel-gazing.’ ‘I’d rather die than go to an analyst, because it’s my view that something fundamentally wrong happens there. If you harshly light every last corner of a house, the house will be uninhabitable. It’s like that with your soul; if you light it up, shadows and darkness and all, people will become “uninhabitable.” I am convinced that it’s psychoanalysis—along with quite a few other mistakes—that has made the twentieth century so terrible. As far as I’m concerned, the twentieth century, in its entirety, was a mistake.’ ‘From my early childhood, I knew what radio and newspapers were even though we didn’t always have electricity, but I never saw a film. I had no notion of cinema. I didn’t know such a thing existed until one day a man with a mobile projector came to us in our one-room village school in Sachrang and showed us a couple of films, which utterly failed to impress me—There were televisions only from the 1960s; it was in Munich that we first watched the news or a soccer game in the janitor’s flat a floor above ours. I experienced the onset of the digital age, the internet, with content chosen for me not by human beings but by algorithms—Social media has essentially changed all forms of communication even though I make no use of them myself. Video games, surveillance, AI, there has never been such a cluster of radical changes in human history, and I can hardly imagine that future generations will experience such density of change in a single human lifespan.’ ‘ —in my childhood—I was quiet, reserved, inclined to sudden outbursts of temper; in general, I was a danger to those around me. I was capable of silent brooding, for instance, because I wanted to understand why six times five came to be the same thing as five times six. It even seemed to be a general principle, so eleven by fourteen was the same as fourteen by eleven. Why? There was a law hidden in the numbers that I could not wrap my head around until I pictured a rectangle with rows of six pieces by five spread out in front of me, and if you turned the shape by ninety degrees, then the principle became visible. Even now I find mathematics thrilling, Riemann’s hypothesis regarding the distribution of prime numbers, for instance. I don’t understand the first thing about it because I don’t have the mathematical equipment, but to me, it’s the most significant of all open questions in mathematics.

            "⚠ Translation error: Herzog es el último de los hombres renacentistas. Lo ha hecho todo, o casi todo. Ordeñador, obrero, soldador, valet parking, futbolista, monaguillo, hipnotista, aventurero, trashumante, vendedor (contrabandista) de armas, director de ópera (sí, es su segunda profesión más importante y yo no lo sabía), escritor, novelista y cineasta (y profesor de cine). Todo eso y más ha sido, y este libro es la narración de todo aquello. No es una biografía como tal, son memorias y están divididas en capítulos más temáticos que temporales, aunque sí empieza por el comienzo: su infancia y su familia. Herzog es hijo de dos padres que fueron pro-nazismo, como muchos, casi todos en aquella época. Nace en plena Segunda Guerra Mundial, en una época de carencias y hambre pero nos cuenta el otro lado de la historia: había felicidad infantil pese a todo. Él vivió en el campo su niñez pero llegó luego a un Berlín posguerra en el que los niños jugaban en los escombros de los edificios derruidos y vivían a sus anchas sin que nadie los controle. Herzog no conoció el cine sino hasta finales de su adolescencia, pero él ya le buscaba el sentido poético-visual a la vida desde siempre. Aprendió griego antiguo y latín en la escuela pero pronto supo que la academia no era lo suyo, así que dejó el colegio, al igual que lo había hecho su hermano años antes y ahí supo que cada persona tiene su talento, no todos están hechos para los estudios convencionales. Su hermano en pocos años se convirtió en un exitoso empresario y él, bueno, Werner, hizo todo lo que hizo. Este libro no tiene una pretensión literaria como sí la tienen sus anteriores libros como \"Conquista de lo inútil\" (que es un lírico diario de rodaje de su película Fitzcarraldo, que trata sobre un cauchero que en el siglo XIX lleva un barco a vapor a traves de la montaña en la selva), o como \"El crepúsculo del mundo\", novela basada en hechos reales sobre el último soldado japonés en rendirse en la Segunda Guerra Mundial, veinticinco años después, pero sí tiene un brillo narrativo genuino procedente de esa vida exprimida hasta el máximo que ha vivido. Este es el tenor de las historias que le gustan a Herzog, que no sólo ha hecho ficción sino también documental, y en general, todas sus obras giran al rededor del hombre y su relación con el entorno o, mejor dicho, de cuando el hombre saca todas sus capacidades máximas para enfrentarse a una magnánima naturaleza. Es el cineasta de los bordes del asombro humano. Ha sido muy enriquecedor enterarme a través de este libro que muchas de las escenas icónicas de sus películas (escenas cautivantes y detonantes dramáticamente) han surgido de experiencias literales de Herzog. Él asegura que no hay simbolismo alguno sino una fijación visual-poética que no tiene significado más allá de esa sensación que produjo aquello en él. Y es que Herzog es el cineasta de las sensaciones, calificado de pasional, cosa que es cierta, pero no disparatado o chalado como a veces se lo ha catalogado, ya que cada \"locura\" que ha cometido en sus rodajes o en su vida han sido casi con un objetivo claro, marcado y determinante. Así como fue su tortuosa relación con el actor Klaus Kinski, con quien rodó cinco películas. No habla mucho de él en este libro (ya le dedicó un magnífico documental: \"Mi mejor enemigo\"), pero sí cuenta cómo le conoció: en una especie de pensión en la que vivía con su madre en Berlín, cuando Kinski era un actor de teatro excéntrico que era mantenido por la dueña de la pensión y que armaba berrinches descomunales donde lo destrozaba todo. Herzog aún era un niño pero, como dice, desde entonces ya sabía a lo que se metía cuando decidió trabajar con Kinski años después. (También cuenta que quiso matarle, o sea lo pensó). Este es un libro sobre una vida llena de vida, valga la redundancia. Sobre un hombre que no se ha guardado ninguna carta bajo la manga, ha vivido a tope y la vida se le ha ido abriendo y entregándole de todo casi sin pedirlo (como la ópera, por ejemplo), pero que ha estado ahí al pie del cañón de lo incierto, con los sentidos alerta, siempre en la misión de descifrar o interpretar el lenguaje de las cosas y el significado del mundo. Y eso es lo que son sus películas, sus documentales, sus libros y hasta sus montajes operísticos. Finalmente, el último tramo es un cuestionamiento a todo lo que el acelerado mundo de la tecnología va dejando atrás. Hergoz cree que en unos miles de años ya no habrán libros ni películas y que quizás el lenguaje escrito y --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",
            "⚠ Translation error: Fitzcarraldo is one of my favourite films. I have watched a lot of Werner Hertog movies and documentaries so I was always going to read his memoir and rather good it is too. Born in 1942 in Munich when the war was in full swing his father was fighting in France and his mother moved the family out to a remote Bavarian village of Sachrang. Sachrang is a place way back in time. It had not reached 1942. To say the family’s life was basic would be an understatement. Let me stop here and say that this is not the normal chronological biography. No way that Herzog was going to write one of those. Instead it is a memoir with 36 chapters of his life jumping all over the place but not in a bad way. He goes over some of his more interesting family members. His stories do not disappoint. He talks about Klaus Kinski, of course, but also his friend, Bruce Chatwin. Then there is Bruno S (Schleinstein). It is one of those books that you just have to go wherever the flow takes you. It takes you on a more winding journey than the steamship in Fitzcarraldo. How Herzog is still alive I’ll never know. He must be close to using up his nine lives. There is no ego here or not one I could detect; ‘Let me stress that I’m just as lazy as the next person…’ OK, that maybe the case but my word he has done and seen a lot. I now realize that I have hardly seen any of his total output. Talk about prolific as director and actor.

            "⚠ Translation error: کتاب تئوری انتخاب کتاب ویلیام گلاسر روانشناسی شخصیت با دید واقع گرایانه می باشد که اساس تئوری بر این اصل استوار است که تمامی انسان‏ها به سبب وجود پنج نیاز ژنتیک: بقا، عشق و احساس تعلق خاطر، قدرت، آزادی و تفریح، برانگیخته می‏شوند. سالها بود روانشناسان، ریشه رفتار انسانها را در محیط آنها جستجو میکردند: آن کارمند من را عصبانی کرد و من فریاد زدم! همسرم، از من حمایت کرد و من انگیزه بیشتر پیدا کردم. شرایط اقتصادی نامساعد است و من امید برای فعالیت اقتصادی ندارم و … همه جملات بالا در یک ویژگی مشترک هستند: اتفاقی در دنیای بیرون رخ داده و روح و ذهن و جسم ما را تحت تأثیر خود قرار داده است. همین دیدگاه بود که روانشناسان را به سمت مکانیزمهای «تشویق و تنبیه» هدایت کرد. شرطی کردن رفتارها (تشویق رفتار درست و تنبیه رفتار نادرست) در همین نگرش ریشه دارد. به این بخش از دانش روانشناسی که اثر عوامل بیرونی بر روی رفتار انسانها را بررسی میکند روانشناسی برون نگر (External Psychology) گفته میشود. حوزه دیگری از روانشناسی وجود دارد که شاید بتوان گفت ویلیام گلاسر با کتاب خود درباره «نظریه انتخاب» یا Choice Theory پایه گذار آن است. در این نگرش جدید، منشاء رفتارها و احساسات و انگیزه های انسانها رویدادهای درونی در نظر گرفته میشود. بر خلاف مازلو که معتقد بود نیازها «سلسله مراتب» دارند و تا یکی از آنها اشباع نشود، نیاز دیگر در وجود ما سر بر نمی دارد، گلاسر معتقد است که اولویت نیازها برای هر کسی متفاوت است. هستند کسانی که برای عشق خود، از جان میگذرند (اولویت نیاز ارتباطی به نیاز زنده ماندن) و هستند کسانی که برای به دست آوردن قدرت نزدیکان خویش را به قتل میرسانند (اولویت داشتن نیاز به قدرت در مقایسه با نیازهای ارتباطی). این نیازها و اولویتهای آنان، ریشه انتخابهای مهم زندگی ما را تشکیل میدهند. هم چنین ،گلاسر ده اصل مهم را به عنوان Ten Axioms of Choice Theory مطرح میکند و به بحث در مورد هر یک از آنها می پردازد. در این قسمت به عناوین این ده اصل اشاره میکنیم اصل اول – ما مالک هیچکس نیستیم و نمی‌توانیم رفتارهای دیگران را «کنترل» کنیم. ما فقط می‌توانیم رفتارهای خودمان را کنترل کنیم. اصل دوم – تنها چیزی که میتوانیم به دیگران بدهیم «اطلاعات» است. اصل سوم – تنها مشکلات روانی که در بلندمدت با انسانها همراه میمانند، «مشکلات عاطفی» است. اصل چهارم – مشکلات عاطفی، بخشی از «زندگی حال حاضر» ما هستند. اصل پنجم – امروز ما را آنچه در گذشته روی داده میسازد، اما نمیتوان در گذشته ماند. تنها کاری که از دست ما بر می آید، ارضاء نیازهای پایه ای در حال حاضر و تلاش برای ارضاء بهتر آنها در آینده است. اصل ششم – ما در ذهن خود تصویری ذهنی از دنیای بیرون داریم که میتوان آن را «دنیای کیفی» نامید و ارضای نیازها یعنی واقعیت بخشیدن به این «دنیای کیفی». اصل هفتم-تنها چیزی که وجود دارد «رفتار ما» است. اصل هشتم – هر رفتار چهار مولفه دارد: حرکت، فکر، احساس و فیزیولوژی اصل نهم – رفتارها انتخاب میشوند اما از میان چهار المان حرکت، فکر، احساس و فیزیولوژی، ما فقط بر روی «حرکت» و «فکر» کنترل داریم. اصل دهم – رفتارها را با «افعال» نامگذاری میکنیم و در نامگذاری عموماً به بخشی از رفتار که برای ما به شکل ساده تری قابل تشخیص و تمایز است، توجه میکنیم. م.نصیری --> No translation was found using the current translator.

And as such, it is an excellent way to understand a bit more about the science of mental health, abut character development, and about Batman himself.

            "⚠ Translation error: Superman wants to save the weak little human race. Spider-Man is just a nice guy with some guilt issues who happens to spin webs. Thor is some divine being thrown to Earth and does some nice stuff for us. Captain America is just too good to be true. Iron Man... I just don't like him so he doesn't count. Batman, compared to them, is one of the most human and flawed of the superheroes -- this, in my opinion, makes him a cut above the rest. I'm a huge Batman fan so “Batman and Psychology” was extremely interesting to me. Clearly well researched and very informative, it will give you the rough basics of an intro to psychology, wrapped in a passionate explanation of the complexities of Batman and much of his supporting cast of friends, heroes and villains. The book is exactly what you'd expect. It delves deeply into the driving forces and assailing demons of the most influential characters in Batman's world, as well as The Dark Knight himself -- their possible motivations, development, future, and disorders. The contributors go through Freud, Jung, and a number of other prominent theories of psychoanalysis to get to the root of Batman and the reflections of his own darkness in their madness. I particularly appreciated the comparison between Batman and, the always recognizable and always insane, Joker. You come to understand the huge irony between the two characters and how one created the other. The symbiotic relationship between the two is explored extensively and by the end of the analysis you realize that joker needs Batman as much as Batman needs him. It is important to note though, that the book reads like a psychology textbook. No action, no drama --so it can be monotonous and boring half the time. Names of psychological afflictions are named again and again, and their defining characteristics listed. The Batman mythos can make psychology interesting, but not captivating. I had an overwhelming sense of relief after I finished this book, like I have just finished midterms or something. Nevertheless, a worthy effort -- for both Travis Langley and his readers. --> No translation was found using the current translator. Try another translator?\n",
